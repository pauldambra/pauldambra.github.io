     "articleBody":"Anyone  who  knows  me  knows  that  I  like  to  talk  about  Event-driven  systems.  And  that  I'm  very  excited  about  serverless  systems  in  utility  computing.\n\nI  started  my  career  in  I.T.  having  to  order  network  cables,  care  about  fuses,  and  plan  storage  and  compute  capacity.  It  was  slow,  frustrating,  and  if  you  got  it  wrong  it  could  take  (best  case  scenario!)  days  to  correct.\n\nOver  a  few  articles  I  hope  to  communicate  what  serverless  is,  why  you  should  find  it  exciting,  and  how  to  start  using  it.\n\nLet's  start  by  defining  our  terms…\n\n\n\nUtility  Computing\n\nAs  a  name,  \"The  Cloud™️\"  is  terrible.  It's  meaningless.  It  totally  fails  to  communicate  what  it  is.  Maybe  it's  a  place  you  put  computers?  Maybe  it's  because  applications  can  \"scale\"  there?\n\nFar  better  to  think  of  \"Utility  Computing\".  United  Utilities  provides  water  as  a  utility  to  properties.  Their  customers  know,  vaguely,  that  there  are  water  mains,  and  reservoirs,  water  treatment  plants,  and  more  but  don't  have  to  care.  They  don't  think  about  that  detail,  they  turn  on  a  tap.\n\nThat's  the  cloud.  Computing  as  a  utility.  You  don't  have  to  care  if  the  provider  is  running  servers  or  containers,  if  they  have  enough  fuses  in  stock,  or  what  model  of  switch  they  bought.  You  turn  on  your  application  and  let  it  run.\n\nEvent-driven  systems\n\nEvents  are  facts.  They  are  things  that  happened  so  they  are  immutable.  An  application  can  store  the  events.\n\nIn  systems  that  are  not  event  driven  the  events  are  still  there  only  they  are  ephemeral,  implied  in  the  API  call,  the  change  in  state,  the  UI  interaction,  etc.  In  the  event-driven  system  they  are  central  to  what  happens.\n\nFowler  describes  multiple  types  of  Event-driven  systems:\n\n\n    Event  Notifications\n\n\nOne  system  registers  with  another.  That  system  raises  an  event:  PersonChangedAddress.  If  the  \"subscriber\"  cares  it  takes  some  action.  In  a  system  where  events  are  notifications  they  might  carry  no  information.  So  the  subscriber  still  needs  to  call  an  API  or  in  some  other  way  load  the  information  it  needs  to  take  an  action.\n\n\n\n\n    Event  Carried  State  Transfer  (should  obvs  be  \"Event  Assisted  State  Transfer\"  or  E.A.S.T.)\n\n\nOne  system  registers  with  another.  That  system  raises  an  event:  PersonChangedAddress  and  includes  at  least  the  new  address  and  the  identifier  for  the  person.  The  subscriber  now  has  all  the  information  it  needs  to  respond  to  the  event.\n\n\n\n\n    Command  Query  Responsibility  Segregation  (CQRS)\n\n\nAn  application  that  separates  writing  to  the  system  (commands)  from  reading  from  it  (queries).\n\nArguably  not  an  event-driven  architecture  since  it  can  be  achieved  without  events.  But  Greg  Young  asserts  it  was  a  necessary  step  to  a  world  that  has  EventSourcing  (in  this  video  IIRC).\n\nHere  one  application  receives  the  command  ChangeAddress.  It  acts  on  it.  That  action  might  raise  an  event,  write  to  a  queue,  write  to  a  database…  the  mechanism  doesn't  matter  for  CQRS.\n\nAnother  application  (or  the  same  one  in  a  different  code  path)  has  the  responsibility  for  querying  the  system.  It  lets  people  view  a  list  of  addresses  but  the  work  of  reading  an  address  for  display  is  much  simpler  (generally)  than  the  work  of  accepting,  validating,  transforming,  and  storing  the  address  on  the  command  side.\n\nCQRS  is  a  big  topic.  Fowler's  description  is  a  good  starting  point.  And  Rob  Ashton  has  a  good  article  showing  varying  levels  of  complexity  of  CQRS  approaches\n\n\n\n\n    EventSourcing\n\n\nAn  event-sourced  system  doesn't  only  respond  to  events  but  builds  its  state  by  replaying  the  events.  For  example  instead  of  storing  an  order:\n\n{\"user\":  \"12345\",  \"items\":  [{\"sku\":  \"54321\",  \"paid\":  \"£1.23\"}]}.\n\nYou  would  store  events:\n\n\n[\n  {\"type\":  \"userStartedOrder\",  \"user\":  \"12345\"},\n  {\"type\":  \"userAddedItemToBasket\",  \"item\":  {\"sku\",  \"54321\"}},\n  {\"type\":  \"userPaidInFull\",  amount:  \"£1.23\"}\n]\n\n\n\nAn  application  can  now  read  all  three  of  those  events  to  generate  the  state  of  the  order.\n\nOr  it  could  read  all  of  the  events  of  type  PersonChangedAddress  and  generate  a  list  of  all  addresses  in  the  system.\n\n\n\nThe  event-driven  approach  has  a  number  of  benefits.  Most  strikingly  flexibility  to  changes  in  business  logic,  the  ability  to  audit  what  has  happened,  and  composability.  Imagine  we  need  to  report  on  stock  and  accounts  changes  -  we  don't  even  need  to  change  any  deployed  module.\n\n\n\nThis  additive  approach  means  that  every  application  that  only  reads  from  the  stream  can  never  add  defects  to  existing  applications!\n\nOk,  never  say  never,  the  chance  of  introducing  a  defect  at  the  system  level  exists  but  is  far,  far  lower  than  in  a  change  that  directly  affects  the  already  deployed  application's  code.\n\nServerless\n\nServerless  continues  this  journey.  It  doesn't  mean  there  aren't  any  servers.  But  it  does  mean  that  you  hardly  have  to  care  there  are  servers.\n\nBefore  I  started  this  I  was  conflating  \"Serverless\"  with  \"Functions-as-a-service\"  (FaaS).\n\nFaaS  is  a  system  where  a  utility  compute  provider  runs  arbitrary  code  on  your  behalf  in  response  to  events  occuring.  No  virtual  machine,  No  network  config,  no  capacity  planning.  Think  AWS  Lambda  or  Azure  Functions.\n\nServerless  implies  event-driven!\n\nAlso  serverless  isn't  only  functions!\n\nStorage,  database,  queues,  and  more  can  be  provided  in  such  a  way  that  they  are  distributed,  highly  available,  elastic,  and  you  don't  have  to  manage,  or  maintain  any  infrastructure.  Well,  ish,  you  have  to  create  the  serverless  components  and  their  connections…  but  not  the  infrastructure  they're  going  to  run  on  (and  it's  patches,  and  new  versions,  and  foibles,  and  …)\n\nSo  that  last  system  diagram  could  be  rewritten:\n\n\n\nGlobally  distributed,  resilient,  highly  available,  scalable,  event-driven  system.  And  somebody  else  manages  all  the  pieces  while  you  fill  it  with  code.\n\nI'm  sold!\n\nLet's  use  a  toy  system  to  explore  it?\n\nI  love  building  event-driven  systems  but  they're  not  the  norm  so  it's  a  long  time  since  I've  had  one  in  production.  While  I  was  off  work  recently  I  thought  I'd  practice.  Since  Serverless  is  the  future  I  decided  to  make  a  serverless  system.  Because  I  know  how  to  have  fun.\n\n\n\nFinding  somewhere  to  take  your  kids  can  be  difficult  and,  since  it  was  half-term,  was  on  my  mind.  It  seems  like  there  are  no  websites  that  are  aware  of  where  you  are,  where  you  could  go,  and  what  the  weather  might  be  like  when  you  get  there…\n\nSo  let's  make  that.\n\nLevel  1:  System  Context  Diagram\n\n\n\nLevel  2:  Container  Diagram\n\n\n\nLevel  3:  Component  Diagram\n\n\n\n(check  out  Simon  Brown's  C4  diagrams  -  they're  💯)\n\nSome  of  this  is  pretty  speculative  but  it's  roughly  the  right  shape.  So  it's  not  worth  designing  any  more  until  I've  learnt  some  more.\n\nThis  is  already  a  massive  post  so  I'll  stop  here.  Next  time  I'll  try  and  have  fewer  of  my  terrible  drawings  and  more  code!\n"

		<p>Anyone who knows me knows that I like to talk about Event-driven systems. And that I'm very excited about serverless systems in utility computing.</p>

<p>I started my career in I.T. having to order network cables, care about fuses, and plan storage and compute capacity. It was slow, frustrating, and if you got it wrong it could take (best case scenario!) days to correct.</p>

<p>Over a few articles I hope to communicate what serverless is, why you should find it exciting, and how to start using it.</p>

<p>Let's start by defining our terms…</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="utility-computing">Utility Computing</h2>

<p>As a name, "The Cloud™️" is terrible. It's meaningless. It totally fails to communicate what it is. Maybe it's a place you put computers? Maybe it's because applications can "scale" there?</p>

<p><em>That's</em> the cloud. Computing as a utility. You don't have to care if the provider is running servers or containers, if they have enough fuses in stock, or what model of switch they bought. You turn on your application and let it run.</p>

<h2 id="event-driven-systems">Event-driven systems</h2>

<p>Events are facts. They are things that happened so they are immutable. An application can store the events.</p>

<p>In systems that are not event driven <strong>the events are still there</strong> only they are ephemeral, implied in the API call, the change in state, the UI interaction, etc. In the event-driven system they are central to what happens.</p>

<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html">Fowler describes multiple types</a> of Event-driven systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Event Notifications</li>
</ol>

<p>One system registers with another. That system raises an event: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PersonChangedAddress</code>. If the "subscriber" cares it takes some action. In a system where events are notifications they might carry no information. So the subscriber still needs to call an API or in some other way load the information it needs to take an action.</p>

  <li>Event Carried State Transfer (should obvs be "Event Assisted State Transfer" or E.A.S.T.)</li>
</ol>

<p>One system registers with another. That system raises an event: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PersonChangedAddress</code> and includes at least the new address and the identifier for the person. The subscriber now has all the information it needs to respond to the event.</p>

  <li><a href="#cqrs">Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</a></li>
</ol>

<p>An application that separates writing to the system (commands) from reading from it (queries).</p>

<p>Arguably not an event-driven architecture since it can be achieved without events. But Greg Young asserts it was a necessary step to a world that has EventSourcing (in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDW0QWie21s">this video</a> IIRC).</p>

<p>Here one application receives the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ChangeAddress</code>. It acts on it. That action might raise an event, write to a queue, write to a database… the mechanism doesn't matter for CQRS.</p>

<p>Another application (or the same one in a different code path) has the responsibility for querying the system. It lets people view a list of addresses but the work of reading an address for display is much simpler (generally) than the work of accepting, validating, transforming, and storing the address on the command side.</p>

<p>CQRS is a <em>big</em> topic. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">Fowler's description</a> is a good starting point. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210307160236/http://codeofrob.com/entries/cqrs-is-too-complicated.html">Rob Ashton has a good article</a> showing varying levels of complexity of CQRS approaches</p>

<p><img src="/images/cqrs.jpg" alt="CQRS system diagram" loading="lazy" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>EventSourcing</li>
</ol>

<p>An event-sourced system doesn't only respond to events but builds its state by replaying the events. For example instead of storing an order:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{"user": "12345", "items": [{"sku": "54321", "paid": "£1.23"}]}</code>.</p>

<p>You would store events:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">
 </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"userStartedOrder"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"user"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"12345"</span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
 </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"userAddedItemToBasket"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">"item"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">"sku"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"54321"</span><span class="p">}},</span><span class="w">
 </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"userPaidInFull"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">amount:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"£1.23"</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>An application can now read all three of those events to generate the state of the order.</p>

<p>Or it could read all of the events of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PersonChangedAddress</code> and generate a list of all addresses in the system.</p>

<p><img src="/images/event-sourced.jpg" alt="event sourcing system diagram" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>The event-driven approach has a number of benefits. Most strikingly flexibility to changes in business logic, the ability to audit what has happened, and composability. Imagine we need to report on stock and accounts changes - we don't even need to change any deployed module.</p>

<p><img src="/images/event-composed.jpg" alt="building on an event driven system diagram" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>This additive approach means that every application that only reads from the stream can never add defects to existing applications!</p>

<p>Ok, never say never, the chance of introducing a defect at the system level exists but is far, far lower than in a change that directly affects the already deployed application's code.</p>

<h2 id="serverless">Serverless</h2>

<p>Serverless continues this journey. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=serverless%20AND%20%22no%20servers%22&amp;src=typd">It doesn't mean there aren't <em>any</em> servers.</a> But it does mean that you hardly have to care there are servers.</p>

<p>Before I started this I was conflating "Serverless" with "Functions-as-a-service" (FaaS).</p>

<p>FaaS is a system where a utility compute provider runs arbitrary code on your behalf in response to events occuring. <a href="https://youtu.be/SKAqmqVQ700?t=1m3s">No virtual machine, No network config, no capacity planning</a>. Think AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.</p>

<p>Serverless <em>implies</em> event-driven!</p>

<p>Also serverless isn't only functions!</p>

<p>Storage, database, queues, and more can be provided in such a way that they are distributed, highly available, elastic, <em>and you don't have to manage, or maintain any infrastructure</em>. Well, ish, you have to create the serverless components and their connections… but not the infrastructure they're going to run on (and it's patches, and new versions, and foibles, and …)</p>

<p>So that last system diagram could be rewritten:</p>

<p><img src="/images/serverless.jpg" alt="serverless event driven system diagram" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>Globally distributed, resilient, highly available, scalable, event-driven system. And somebody else manages all the pieces while you fill it with code.</p>

<p>I'm sold!</p>

<h1 id="lets-use-a-toy-system-to-explore-it">Let's use a toy system to explore it?</h1>

<p>I <em>love</em> building event-driven systems but they're not the norm so it's a long time since I've had one in production. While I was off work recently I thought I'd practice. Since Serverless is <em>the future</em> I decided to make a serverless system. Because I know how to have fun.</p>

<!--alex ignore kids --->

<p>Finding somewhere to take your kids can be difficult and, since it was half-term, was on my mind. It seems like there are no websites that are aware of where you are, where you could go, and what the weather might be like when you get there…</p>

<p>So let's make that.</p>

<p>(check out <a href="https://c4model.com/">Simon Brown's C4 diagrams</a> - they're 💯)</p>

<p>Some of this is pretty speculative but it's roughly the right shape. So it's not worth designing any more until I've learnt some more.</p>

<p>This is already a massive post so I'll stop here. Next time I'll try and have fewer of my terrible drawings and more code!</p>

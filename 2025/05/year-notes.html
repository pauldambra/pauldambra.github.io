		<p>I remain super un-inspired to write over the last few years. Which is a shame - because it's a a great way to learn. And very uninspired to write about 2024 in particular. So, here are some very short year notes for 2024.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="why-dont-i-want-to-write-about-2024">Why don't I want to write about 2024…</h1>

<p>2024 was in some ways great, genuinely so, life is good…</p>

<p>But it was over-shadowed by grief and the preparation for grief. You can find out about that in this post <a href="https://pauldambra.dev/2024/09/wwmd.html">https://pauldambra.dev/2024/09/wwmd.html</a> (unless you'd like to avoid grief)</p>

<h1 id="goals-i-chose-for-2024">Goals I chose for 2024</h1>

<h3 id="work">work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>continue becoming a better engineer and team-mate</li>
  <li>take more time to lift my head up and look at the horizon</li>
  <li>get better at digging into tricky problems</li>
  <li>get better at not being distracted by tricky problems if there is some higher value work I should be doing</li>
  <li>speak to customers for at least 5 hours over the year</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="home">home</h3>

<ul>
  <li>more time with my family (screens off, not watching telly)</li>
  <li>solidify my transactional Italian, figure out how to head towards conversational Italian</li>
  <li>train at the gym at least twice a week every week (and lose weight)</li>
  <li>visit Italy at least twice</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p>Google doesn't support timeline in the web view anymore… 🤷
So, no image of my travel</p>

<p>I visited</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sicily
    <ul>
      <li>to hack on a heatmaps product</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Valencia
    <ul>
      <li>for a team offsite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vienna
    <ul>
      <li>for a team onboarding</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mykonos
    <ul>
      <li>for the whole company offsite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>it is wild to me to consider that much travel in a year that felt so small</p>

<h2 id="work-1">Work</h2>

<p>At one point I was outside The Christie in Manchester (a specialist cancer treatment hospital we are so lucky to have). I overheard a man on the phone, anxious, agitated, almost shouting: "they've said they can't see me! i can't come back another day. if i have to take more time off work i'll lose my job".</p>

<p>I am uncountably grateful to have a job where I was told to take whatever time I needed. Where colleagues picked up the slack. And that I enjoy so much.</p>

<h1 id="me">Me</h1>

<p>I lost 12kg in 2024. The unrelenting drudgery of not eating is so dull.</p>

<p>I've continued enjoying cooking. Food has always been an expression of love in my life.</p>

<h2 id="first-pasta-of-2024">first pasta of 2024</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2025/05/first-pasta-2024.jpg" alt="the first pasta I cooked in 2024" loading="lazy" /></p>

<h2 id="last-pasta-of-2024">last pasta of 2024</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2025/05/last-pasta-2024.jpg" alt="the last pasta I cooked in 2024" loading="lazy" /></p>

<h2 id="my-favourite-moment-of-2024">My favourite moment of 2024?</h2>

<p>Cheesy, but it was when my dad said "i'd be happy to be served that pasta in Italy"</p>

<p><img src="/images/2025/05/dad-pasta-2024.jpg" alt="the pasta my dad thought was good enough for italy" loading="lazy" /></p>

<h1 id="what-writing-this-taught-me-i-want-to-do-in-2025">What writing this taught me I want to do in 2025</h1>

<p>OMG I have no idea… we're nearly 6 months through. I think I just need a year without life-grinding disruption.</p>

<p>Let's just carry everything forwards…</p>

<h3 id="work-2">work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>continue becoming a better engineer and team-mate</li>
  <li>take more time to lift my head up and look at the horizon</li>
  <li>get better at digging into tricky problems</li>
  <li>get better at not being distracted by tricky problems if there is some higher value work I should be doing</li>
  <li>speak to customers for at least 5 hours over the year</li>
</ul>

     "articleBody":"An  amazing  engineer  colleague  has  taken  on  (booming,  god-on-the-mountain  voice)  extra  responsibilities.  Unfortunately  for  them,  one  of  those  responsibilities  is  managing  me.\n\nThey  asked  me  how  I  like  to  be  managed.  I  thought  it  was  a  good  question,  so  I  pushed  it  into  my  background  processing  queue,  got  distracted,  and  never  answered  them.\n\nPeriodically  I  feel  guilty  about  that,  so  I  thought  I'd  write  it  down  here.  Maybe  it  will  help  me  decide  what  my  answer  is…\n\n\n\nI  guess  I  should  consider  a  few  different  things:\n\n\n    when  I've  not  been  managed  well\n    when  I've  been  managed  well\n\n\nWhen  I've  not  been  managed  well\n\nThe  fool\n\nMany  years  ago,  I  was  working  for  a  large  Enterprise  omni-clopse  style  technology  services  company.  I  was  young  and  didn't  know  what  I  wanted  from  life.\n\nWell,  that's  not  quite  true.  I  wanted  to  change  the  world  of  long,  loud  rock  music.  But  I  was  kidding  myself.\n\nI  had  fallen  into  a  job  as  an  infrastructure  engineer  because  I'm  pretty  good  at  solving  problems  and  I  like  computers.\n\nThe  person  managing  me  was…  well…  they  were  the  worst  manager  I've  ever  had.  I  didn't  know  that  at  the  time.  I'd  not  had  many  managers  before,  so  I  didn't  know  what  to  expect.\n\nThere  came  a  point  where  I  wanted  to  be  a  software  engineer.  In  a  1-2-1  they  asked  me  about  my  goals,  and  I  shared  that.  They  gave  me  a  long  rambling  speech  about  how  I  wouldn't  enjoy  that.\n\nI've  been  a  software  engineer  for  a  long  time  now,  and  I  love  it.\n\nI  take  responsibility  for  my  mistakes…  listening  to  them  was  a  mistake,  and  that's  on  me.  But  I  am  pretty  certain  I  would  have  been  a  software  engineer  years  earlier  if  I  hadn't  listened  to  them.\n\nThe  absent  manager\n\nFor  a  short  while  I  was  at  a  consulting  company.  My  manager  was  on  the  same  team  as  me.  I  think…  it  was  never  clear.\n\nI  don't  remember  a  single  1-2-1  in  the  time  I  was  there.  Particularly,  I  don't  once  remember  feeling  pushed  or  supported.  I  didn't  think  I  was  doing  super  well\n\nAgain,  I  could  have  done  something  about  this…  I'm  not  looking  for  someone  at  fault.  But  on  reflection  one  of  the  reasons  I  left  that  job  was  a  lack  of  feedback  and  a  feeling  I  wasn't  valued\n\nWhen  I've  been  managed  well\n\ntimely  feedback\n\nIn  a  1-2-1  a  long  time  ago,  my  manager  said:  \"I'm  too  busy.  And  I  value  that  when  I  see  an  email  chain,  and  I  see  you've  replied,  I  can  ignore  it.  Because  I  know  it'll  be  sorted  out.\"\n\nI  didn't  think  of  myself  that  way.  It  was  super  clear  about  what  was  happening.  And  how  I  could  continue  or  level  it  up.\n\nI'm  not  in  touch  with  them  anymore,  but  that  short  feedback  changed  my  approach  more  than  any  other  moment  I'm  aware  of\n\nAnd  the  reverse,  a  different  manager  said  (paraphrasing)  \"I  need  you  to  decide  when  to  stop  working  on  something.\"  Really  clear,  timely  example  of  what  I  was  getting  wrong,  and  how  I  could  fix  things.\n\nI  am…  very  easily  distracted.  One  person  described  it  as  a  \"curiosity-driven  approach  to  work.\"\n\nI  used  to  apologise  about  this  and  try  hard  to  avoid  it.  Until  a  colleague  said:  (paraphrasing)  \"the  thing  is,  you're  good  at  it  -  why  don't  you  just  try  and  get  better,  instead  of  fighting  yourself.\"\n\nThis  has  been  transformative.  I'm  more  productive,  more  present  as  a  parent,  and  less  stressed  about  my  behaviour  (not  the  same  as  thinking  I  always  get  it  right  🙈)\n\ncontext,  context,  context\n\nAnother  thing  I  value  —  the  larger  or  faster  the  organization  the  more  I  miss  it.\n\nA  more  senior  colleague  often  has  context  that  you  don't.  Your  manager  is  often  that  person.  And  sharing  that  with  you  is  super  valuable.\n\nThat  might  be  how  you're  seen  (\"your  long  to-do  lists  don't  help  people  understand  what  you're  working  on\").\n\nIt  might  be  organizational  context,  for  example,  once  I  was  worrying  about  the  specifics  of  a  deadline,  a  senior  colleague  said:  \"We  have  to  spend  90%  of  the  marketing  budget  printing  posters  by  the  second  week  of  the  financial  year.  Nobody  will  care  if  your  deadline  moves,  but  some  will  really  care  if  you  know  you'll  miss  it  completely.  Because  they  can't  afford  to  reprint.\"\n\nSuddenly,  I  didn't  have  to  plan  what  week  I  would  hit  something.  Just  how  confident  I  was  for  a  \"yes/no\"  decision.  Way  easier,  and  more  helpful!\n\nOr,  when  an  exec  at  omniclopse  was  a  shouty-man,  throwing  salesforce  at  every  problem.  Learning  that  they'd  been  hired  specifically  to  implement  salesforce  completely  changed  my  understanding  of  their  needs.  They  were  trapped  doing  something  they  didn't  want  to  do  until  they  could  point  at  implemented  salesforce.  And  I  was  trapped  with  them  until  then…\n\nThat  made  my  job  so  much  easier.\n\nexperience  /  the  coach\n\nThe  person  managing  you  has  different  experience  to  you.\n\nA  previous  manager  was  a  purposeful  politician.  Helping  me  understand  that  I  had  to  give  a  Director  level  colleague  \"something  to  say  yes  to\"  instead  of  showing  them  why  they  were  wrong  (spoiler  they  were  definitely  wrong.  I  know  I  sometimes  am…  but  not  that  time).  By  giving  them  something  to  say  yes  to,  we  could  get  past  the  loggerhead  we  were  stuck  at.\n\nAnother  manager  was  great  at  coaching  questions.  Pushing  you  to  see  where  you  were  missing  something  and  to  figure  out  how  to  address  it.  Long  walks,  with  tough  questions,  that  sometimes  ended  with  ice-cream  🧑‍🍳👌\n\nDoes  this  help  me  answer  their  question?\n\n\n    timely  feedback.\n        \n            we're  all  works-in-progress  and  don't  always  see  what  we're  getting  right  or  wrong\n            in-person  feedback  is  the  gold  standard,  but  I  prefer  feedback  sooner.  so  async  is  better  than  missed\n        \n    \n    similarly  \"the  coach\"\n        \n            I  worry  that  I'm  not  great  at  reflecting  on  my  work\n            I  also  find  impostor  syndrome  a  real  problem,\n            and  I'm  \"senior\"  enough  that  people  assume  I  know  what  I'm  doing\n            So,  I  worry  that  I  get  less  feedback  than  I  otherwise  would\n            So,  I  love  to  hear  critical  feedback  as  much  as  positive\n            I'd  rather  be  asked  the  uncomfortable  question  than  miss  the  opportunity  to  improve\n        \n    \n    context,  context,  context\n        \n            one  colleague  would  refer  to  the  \"Chief  Reminding  Officer\"\n            it's  easy  to  get  lost  in  the  forest  even  with  a  map  in  hand\n            your  manager  often  has  a  very  different  viewpoint  (and  worries  they're  too  far  from  the  forest)\n            I'd  rather  be  reminded  of  the  context  more  often  than  I  need\n        \n    \n\n"

		<p>An amazing engineer colleague has taken on (booming, god-on-the-mountain voice) extra responsibilities. Unfortunately for them, one of those responsibilities is managing me.</p>

<p>They asked me how I like to be managed. I thought it was a good question, so I pushed it into my background processing queue, got distracted, and never answered them.</p>

<p>Periodically I feel guilty about that, so I thought I'd write it down here. Maybe it will help me decide what my answer is…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I guess I should consider a few different things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I've not been managed well</li>
  <li>when I've been managed well</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="when-ive-not-been-managed-well">When I've not been managed well</h1>

<h2 id="the-fool">The fool</h2>

<p>Many years ago, I was working for a large Enterprise omni-clopse style technology services company. I was young and didn't know what I wanted from life.</p>

<p>Well, that's not quite true. I wanted to change the world of long, loud rock music. But I was kidding myself.</p>

<p>I've been a software engineer for a long time now, and I love it.</p>

<p>I take responsibility for my mistakes… listening to them was a mistake, and that's on me. But I am pretty certain I would have been a software engineer years earlier if I hadn't listened to them.</p>

<h2 id="the-absent-manager">The absent manager</h2>

<p>For a short while I was at a consulting company. My manager was on the same team as me. I think… it was never clear.</p>

<p>I don't remember a single 1-2-1 in the time I was there. Particularly, I don't once remember feeling pushed or supported. I didn't think I was doing super well</p>

<p>Again, I could have done something about this… I'm not looking for someone at fault. But on reflection one of the reasons I left that job was a lack of feedback and a feeling I wasn't valued</p>

<h1 id="when-ive-been-managed-well">When I've been managed well</h1>

<h2 id="timely-feedback">timely feedback</h2>

<p>And the reverse, a different manager said (paraphrasing) "I need you to decide when to stop working on something." Really clear, timely example of what I was getting wrong, and how I could fix things.</p>

<p>I am… very easily distracted. One person described it as a "curiosity-driven approach to work."</p>

<p>I used to apologise about this and try hard to avoid it. Until a colleague said: (paraphrasing) "the thing is, you're good at it - why don't you just try and get better, instead of fighting yourself."</p>

<p>This has been transformative. I'm more productive, more present as a parent, and less stressed about my behaviour (not the same as thinking I always get it right 🙈)</p>

<h2 id="context-context-context">context, context, context</h2>

<p>Another thing I value — the larger or faster the organization the more I miss it.</p>

<p>A more senior colleague often has context that you don't. Your manager is often that person. And sharing that with you is super valuable.</p>

<p>That might be how you're seen ("your long to-do lists don't help people understand what you're working on").</p>

<p>It might be organizational context, for example, once I was worrying about the specifics of a deadline, a senior colleague said: "We have to spend 90% of the marketing budget printing posters by the second week of the financial year. Nobody will care if your deadline moves, but some will really care if you know you'll miss it completely. Because they can't afford to reprint."</p>

<p>Suddenly, I didn't have to plan what week I would hit something. Just how confident I was for a "yes/no" decision. Way easier, and more helpful!</p>

<p>Or, when an exec at omniclopse was a shouty-man, throwing salesforce at every problem. Learning that they'd been hired specifically to implement salesforce completely changed my understanding of their needs. They were trapped doing something they didn't want to do until they could point at implemented salesforce. And I was trapped with them until then…</p>

<p>That made my job so much easier.</p>

<h2 id="experience--the-coach">experience / the coach</h2>

<p>The person managing you has different experience to you.</p>

<p>A previous manager was a purposeful politician. Helping me understand that I had to give a Director level colleague "something to say yes to" instead of showing them why they were wrong (spoiler they were definitely wrong. I know I sometimes am… but not that time). By giving them something to say yes to, we could get past the loggerhead we were stuck at.</p>

<p>Another manager was great at coaching questions. Pushing you to see where you were missing something and to figure out how to address it. Long walks, with tough questions, that sometimes ended with ice-cream 🧑‍🍳👌</p>

<h1 id="does-this-help-me-answer-their-question">Does this help me answer their question?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>timely feedback.
    <ul>
      <li>we're all works-in-progress and don't always see what we're getting right or wrong</li>
      <li>in-person feedback is the gold standard, but I prefer feedback sooner. so async is better than missed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>similarly "the coach"
    <ul>
      <li>I worry that I'm not great at reflecting on my work</li>
      <li>I also find impostor syndrome a real problem,</li>
      <li>and I'm "senior" enough that people assume I know what I'm doing</li>
      <li>So, I worry that I get less feedback than I otherwise would</li>
      <li>So, I love to hear critical feedback as much as positive</li>
      <li>I'd rather be asked the uncomfortable question than miss the opportunity to improve</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>context, context, context
    <ul>
      <li>one colleague would refer to the "Chief Reminding Officer"</li>
      <li>it's easy to get lost in the forest even with a map in hand</li>
      <li>your manager often has a very different viewpoint (and worries they're too far from the forest)</li>
      <li>I'd rather be reminded of the context more often than I need</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## 2020 Week 3

🏥 2 poorly kids and full of a cold. So 2 days working from home<br/>
💼 2 days at internal events<br/>
🛏️ I'm frazzled<br/>
🦸‍♀️ Wonderful that we kicked off day two with a reminder that presenting is hard so send love to the stage<br/>
💖 And brill to end with a very senior bod willing to show emotion to a very large audience<br/>
💻 Wrote some code while I was stuck at home<br/>
💪 Launched a secret thing<br/>
🕵️‍♂️ Wish it wasn't secret<br/>
💎 saw multiple same day fixes from more than one team<br/>
📊 big decision to make<br/>
✏️ wrote this in the gitlab web UI. It wasn't too bad<br/>
✅ had fun

     "articleBody":"Forgive  me,  for  I  have  sinned,  it's  been  2  years  since  my  last  year  notes  👼\n\nI  wrote  year  notes  for  2019,  and  2020.  I've  been  super  un-inspired  to  write  for  the  last  few  years.  Which  is  a  shame  -  because  it's  a  a  great  way  to  learn.\n\nSo  much  happened  last  year  that  it  feels  way  longer  than  a  year.  So,  discipline  over  motiviation  -  here  are  my  2022  year  notes.  Or  at  least  as  much  as  I  can  write  while  the  house  is  empty  of  other  people.\n\n\n\nGoals  from  2021  year  notes\n\nand  whether  I  achieved  them  or  not\n\n(slightly  reogranised  since  I  see  themes  with  hindsight  that  I  didn't  at  the  time)\n\nleadership\n\n\n    ❓  read  about  leadership  and  get  over  myself\n    ❓  by  March  understand  what  business  and  team  goals  I'm  contributing  to\n    😅  meet  one-on-one  with  everyone  on  my  team  at  least  once\n    😅  keep  those  meetings  going  with  some  of  them\n\n\nIn  retrospect  I  was  struggling  with  a  role  that  was  poltical  and  not  technical.  2021  saw  me  move  teams,  see  that  the  grass  wasn't  greener,  realise  that  the  garden  was  (for  me)  poisoned,  and  move  jobs  to  a  technical  role.\n\nwriting  software\n\n\n    🙃  record  a  video  of  event  sourcing  from  scratch\n        \n            started  but  not  completed\n            three  videos  I  recorded\n        \n    \n    ✅  make  time  to  write  code  for  days  at  a  time\n\n\nAnd  the  move  (back)  to  a  technical  role  was  harder  than  I  anticipated.  New  stack,  new  org,  new  culture.  But  I  wouldn't  change  the  decision  for  all  the  money  in  the  world  (well,  maybe  all  the  money)\n\nmyself\n\n\n    ❌  start  weeknotes  again\n    ✅  practice  Italian  every  day\n    ❌  15km  running  on  average  over  40  weeks  of  the  year\n        \n            43  runs  totalling  168km  =  3.9km  per  run\n            I  ended  up  struggling  with  achilles  pain  in  2021  and  hardly  running  at  all  in  2022\n            but  physio  is  helping\n        \n    \n    ✅  4  leisurely  cycle  rides\n        \n            not  in  2021,  but  I  did  in  2022\n        \n    \n\n\nI'm  more  who  I  want  to  be,  but  there's  more  to  do\n\nmy  world\n\n\n\n\n    👀  use  the  unfair  super  power  of  being  a  white,  middle-class,  middle-aged,  straight  man  to  lift  others  up\n\n\nThis  is  the  least  I  could  do.  I  should  take  it  for  granted  and  figure  out  the  answer  to  \"Great,  you  want  to  help  others,  so  what?\"\n\nSo,  2022\n\nTravel\n\nWorking  at  PostHog  comes  with  a  number  of  benefits.  Freedom  to  travel  because  the  work  is  remote,  and  travel  for  the  work,  is  one  that  I've  been  loving!\n\n\n\nIn  2022  I  visited  6  countries\n\n\n    Barcelona,  Spain\n        \n            for  the  engineering  offsite\n        \n    \n    Reykjavik,  Iceland\n        \n            for  the  all  company  offsite\n        \n    \n    Forte  Di  Marme,  Italy\n        \n            because  I  wanted  to  take  the  kids  to  Italy  with  their  Nonno\n        \n    \n    Pescara,  Italy\n        \n            for  ten  days  because  my  family  are  wonderful  and  I  wanted  to  spend  time  in  Italy\n        \n    \n    Rome,  Italy\n        \n            for  the  product  analytics  team  offsite\n        \n    \n    Paris,  France\n        \n            because  I  wanted  to  take  the  kids  to  Paris\n        \n    \n    Lisbon,  Portugal\n        \n            because  we  have  a  budget  to  meet  each  other,\n            my  colleague  let  us  use  their  house  for  free,\n            so  Ben/Paul  super-fun-time  could  happen  to  make  real  user  monitoring.\n            I've  never  worked  anywhere  where  we  are  as  free  to  choose  our  own  goals\n        \n    \n\n\nI  spent  nearly  20  days  in  Italy  in  2022.  More  than  I've  spent  there  for  20  years.  The  older  I  get,  the  more  I  value  my  heritage  (#SoCliche).  My  spoken  Italian  has  progressed  from  \"Nouns  and  pointing\"  to  \"Hangry  three  year  old\".\n\nTravelling  for  work  has  been  an  incredible  thing.  Lisbon  was  superb.  It  was  fun  to  have  a  goal,  work  hard  all  day,  and  then  have  food  and  chat  in  the  evenings.  Barcelona,  Rome,  and  Reykjavik  were  amazing.  I'm  convinced  that  intermittently  coming  together  is  one  of  the  things  that  makes  remote  work,  erm,  work.  Not  only  that  though.  Having  a  budget  to  meet  and  socialise  is  a  super  power.\n\nPescara  was  like  breathing  out.  It's  only  the  second  time  in  my  life  I've  travelled  overseas  by  myself.  And  it's  the  longest  I've  spent  not  needing  to  parent  for  a  decade  and  a  half.  I'm  incredibly  lucky  that  my  family  put  up  with  me  being  away.\n\nWork\n\n\n\nInterestingly,  there's  a  step  change  in  my  GitHub  contributions  around  the  time  I  went  to  Pescara  too.  And,  without  wanting  to  seem  big-headed,  I  think,  a  step  change  in  my  performance  at  work  too.\n\nChanging  back  from  a  leadership  role  to  a  typey-typey-software  role,  at  the  end  of  2021,  was  way  more  of  a  change  than  I  anticipated.  Alongside  going  all-remote  and  discovering  which  habits  that  helped  in  an  office  job  that  don't  help  anymore.  It's  amazing  how  much  engineering  you  can  forget  in  four  years  of  talking  to  people  about  engineering.\n\nWhat  do  I  think  has  helped  🤔\n\n\n    cadence\n        \n            I  like  to  have  a  large(r)  spike  PR  where  I  can  experiment  and  gather  feedback\n            and  then  splitting  smaller  pieces  of  work  from  that\n            the  smaller  pieces  are  easier  to  engineer  well\n            and  way  more  safe  to  release\n            aiming  for  merging  more  than  one  PR  a  day\n        \n    \n    stopping  and  thinking\n        \n            decide  a  goal,  figure  out  how  to  get  there,  figure  out  how  much  of  your  time  to  give  it\n            and  then  do  that\n        \n    \n    extreme  ownershp  and  turn  the  ship  around\n        \n            a  very  incredible  colleague  bought  me  \"turn  the  ship  around\"\n            another  incredible  colleague  suggested  \"extreme  ownership\"\n            they're  both  great  books\n                \n                    although  I  struggled  with  the  \"yee-haw  shoot  people\"  presentation  of  extreme  ownsership\n                \n            \n            \"This  isn't  going  to  happen  until  I  make  it  happen!  -&gt;  How  do  I  make  it  happen?  -&gt;  How  do  I  remove  things  stopping  it  happening?\"\n        \n    \n    improvements  accrue  if  you  let  them\n        \n            this  is  maybe  a  corollary  of  \"stopping  and  thinking\"\n            I  had  a  great  pairing  session  where  a  colleague  made  (to  them)  a  throw  away  comment  about  how  React  works\n            it  changed  the  model  of  how  I  think  about  it.\n            Spotting  that,  I  asked  myself  how  that  should  change  how  I  approach  work\n            the  last  three  months  I've  been  working  with  another  colleague  on  application  performance  (the  back-end  of  the  back-end)\n            they're  incredible,  if  I  can  learn  1%  of  their  skill  I'll  consider  it  a  success\n            but  now  I  want  to  find  other  work  I  can  prioritise  to  practice  what  I  think  I've  learned  so  I  can  trick  my  brain  into  storing  the  knowledge\n        \n    \n    talking  to  users\n        \n            I've  spent  time  supporting  users\n            joining  video  calls  to  help  them\n            running  user  interviews\n            understanding  the  users  and  seeing  the  struggles  they  have  is  💯\n            I've  been  working  a  lot  on  our  dashboards,  not  because  I  thought  it  was  important  but  because  they  did.\n        \n    \n\n\nAnnoyingly,  I  not  sure  I  know  what  made  the  difference.  I  really  want  to  figure  it  out  so  I  can  take  advantage  of  it  well.  I'm  surrounded  by  amazing  people  and  finding  that  wonderfully  motivating.\n\n### Open  Source\n\nA  brief  aside  about  working  on  open  source  software.  An  unexpected  (for  me)  side-effect  has  been  how  incredible  it  is  to  be  able  to  share  exactly  what  I  mean  when  talking  to  people  about  software.  \"I  think  it  is  good  to  do  X\"  becomes  \"Here's  a  PR  (or  set  of  them)  that  I  think  demonstrate  a  way  to  do  X  well\".\n\nI  think  that's  awesome.\n\nAlso,  sometimes  in  remote  work  I  miss  the  power  of  someone  looking  over  your  shoulder  while  you  work.  It's  way  harder  to  cut  corners  when  someone  is  watching.  Remembering  that  anyone  can  watch  my  work  helps  remind  me  to  take  the  step  from  \"make  it  work\"  to  then  \"make  it  right\"\n\n\n\nFor  example,  I  fixed  a  bunch  of  bugs  in  our  dashboards  product  (I  think  more  than  I  introduced  😅).  In  doing  that  we  learned  about  what  made  it  easier  to  introduce  those  bugs  than  to  avoid  them.  I  could  have  moved  back  on  to  my  main  priority…  but  the  world  is  watching,  so  I  figured  out  a  way  to  make  it  harder  to  introduce  the  bugs  than  to  avoid  them  (\"four  rules  of  simple  design\"  for  the  win)  https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/13630\n\nKids\n\n\n\nSince  last  year  notes  I've  graduated  from  three  kids  to  four  kids.  It's  still  incredible.  I'm  still  always  very  tired.  So  amazingly  worth  it.  They  have  said  they  don't  want  to  be  on  social  media  so  I  won't  mention  much  here.\n\nAnd  now  they're  home…  so  I'm  going  to  publish  without  editing  and  procrastinating.\n\nWhat  writing  this  taught  me  I  want  to  do  in  2023\n\n\n    continue  becoming  a  better  engineer  and  team-mate\n    practice  Italian  every  day\n    train  at  the  gym  at  least  twice  a  week  every  week\n    8  leisurely  cycle  rides\n    visit  Italy  at  least  twice\n\n"

		<p>Forgive me, for I have sinned, it's been 2 years since my last year notes 👼</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="/2020/01/year-notes.html">year notes for 2019</a>, <a href="/2021/01/year-notes.html">and 2020</a>. I've been super un-inspired to write for the last few years. Which is a shame - because it's a a great way to learn.</p>

<p>So much happened last year that it feels way longer than a year. So, discipline over motiviation - here are my 2022 year notes. Or at least as much as I can write while the house is empty of other people.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="goals-from-2021-year-notes">Goals from 2021 year notes</h1>

<p><em>and whether I achieved them or not</em></p>

<p><em>(slightly reogranised since I see themes with hindsight that I didn't at the time)</em></p>

<h2 id="leadership">leadership</h2>

<ul>
  <li>❓ read about leadership and get over myself</li>
  <li>❓ by March understand what business and team goals I'm contributing to</li>
  <li>😅 meet one-on-one with everyone on my team at least once</li>
  <li>😅 keep those meetings going with some of them</li>
</ul>

<p>In retrospect I was struggling with a role that was poltical and not technical. 2021 saw me move teams, see that the grass wasn't greener, realise that the garden was (for me) poisoned, and move jobs to a technical role.</p>

<h2 id="writing-software">writing software</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🙃 record a video of event sourcing from scratch
    <ul>
      <li>started but not completed</li>
      <li><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosfMbzQO-j0C-IvdhzQ0G2qwtH6bnxqd">three videos I recorded</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>✅ make time to write code <em>for days at a time</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And the move (back) to a technical role was harder than I anticipated. New stack, new org, new culture. But I wouldn't change the decision for all the money in the world (well, maybe <em>all</em> the money)</p>

<h2 id="myself">myself</h2>

<ul>
  <li>❌ start weeknotes again</li>
  <li>✅ practice Italian every day</li>
  <li>❌ 15km running on average over 40 weeks of the year
    <ul>
      <li>43 runs totalling 168km = 3.9km per run</li>
      <li>I ended up struggling with achilles pain in 2021 and hardly running at all in 2022</li>
      <li>but physio is helping</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>✅ 4 leisurely cycle rides
    <ul>
      <li>not in 2021, but I did in 2022</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm more who I want to be, but there's more to do</p>

<h2 id="my-world">my world</h2>

<!--alex ignore white-->

<ul>
  <li>👀 use the unfair super power of being a white, middle-class, middle-aged, straight man to lift others up</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the least I could do. I should take it for granted and figure out the answer to "Great, you want to help others, so what?"</p>

<p>So, 2022</p>

<h1 id="travel">Travel</h1>

<p>Working at <a href="https://posthog.com">PostHog</a> comes with a number of benefits. Freedom to travel because the work is remote, and travel <em>for</em> the work, is one that I've been loving!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2022-travel.png" alt="2022 travel map from Google Maps showing the countries and places I visited" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>In 2022 I visited 6 countries</p>

<ul>
  <li>Barcelona, Spain
    <ul>
      <li>for the engineering offsite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reykjavik, Iceland
    <ul>
      <li>for the all company offsite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Forte Di Marme, Italy
    <ul>
      <li>because I wanted to take the kids to Italy with their Nonno</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pescara, Italy
    <ul>
      <li>for ten days because my family are wonderful and I wanted to spend time in Italy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rome, Italy
    <ul>
      <li>for the product analytics team offsite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Paris, France
    <ul>
      <li>because I wanted to take the kids to Paris</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lisbon, Portugal
    <ul>
      <li>because we have a budget to meet each other,</li>
      <li>my colleague let us use their house for free,</li>
      <li>so Ben/Paul super-fun-time could happen to make real user monitoring.</li>
      <li>I've never worked anywhere where we are as free to choose our own goals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I spent nearly 20 days in Italy in 2022. More than I've spent there for 20 years. The older I get, the more I value my heritage (#SoCliche). My spoken Italian has progressed from "Nouns and pointing" to "Hangry three year old".</p>

<p>Travelling for work has been an incredible thing. Lisbon was superb. It was fun to have a goal, work hard all day, and then have food and chat in the evenings. Barcelona, Rome, and Reykjavik were amazing. I'm convinced that intermittently coming together is one of the things that makes remote work, erm, work. Not only that though. Having <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/people/spending-money#budget-for-socializing">a budget to meet and socialise</a> is a super power.</p>

<p>Pescara was like breathing out. It's only the second time in my life I've travelled overseas by myself. And it's the longest I've spent not needing to parent for a decade and a half. I'm incredibly lucky that my family put up with me being away.</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p><img src="/images/2022-contributions.png" alt="2022 contributions graph from GitHub showing a step-change around June" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, there's a step change in my GitHub contributions around the time I went to Pescara too. And, without wanting to seem big-headed, I think, a step change in my performance at work too.</p>

<p>Changing back from a leadership role to a typey-typey-software role, at the end of 2021, was way more of a change than I anticipated. Alongside going all-remote and discovering which habits that helped in an office job that don't help anymore. It's amazing how much engineering you can forget in four years of talking to people about engineering.</p>

<p>What do I think has helped 🤔</p>

<ul>
  <li>cadence
    <ul>
      <li>I like to have a large(r) spike PR where I can experiment and gather feedback</li>
      <li>and then splitting smaller pieces of work from that</li>
      <li>the smaller pieces are easier to engineer well</li>
      <li>and way more safe to release</li>
      <li>aiming for merging more than one PR a day</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>stopping and thinking
    <ul>
      <li>decide a goal, figure out how to get there, figure out how much of your time to give it</li>
      <li>and then do that</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>extreme ownershp and turn the ship around
    <ul>
      <li>a very incredible colleague bought me <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around">"turn the ship around"</a></li>
      <li>another incredible colleague suggested <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23848190-extreme-ownership">"extreme ownership"</a></li>
      <li>they're both great books
        <ul>
          <li>although I struggled with the "yee-haw shoot people" presentation of extreme ownsership</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>"This isn't going to happen until I make it happen! -&gt; How do I make it happen? -&gt; How do I remove things stopping it happening?"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>improvements accrue if you let them
    <ul>
      <li>this is maybe a corollary of "stopping and thinking"</li>
      <li>I had a great pairing session where a colleague made (to them) a throw away comment about how React works</li>
      <li>it changed the model of how I think about it.</li>
      <li>Spotting that, I asked myself how that should change how I approach work</li>
      <li>the last three months I've been working with another colleague on application performance (the back-end of the back-end)</li>
      <li>they're incredible, if I can learn 1% of their skill I'll consider it a success</li>
      <li>but now I want to <a href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/13700">find other work</a> I can prioritise to practice what I think I've learned so I can trick my brain into storing the knowledge</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>talking to users
    <ul>
      <li>I've spent time supporting users</li>
      <li>joining video calls to help them</li>
      <li>running user interviews</li>
      <li>understanding the users and seeing the struggles they have is 💯</li>
      <li>I've been working a lot on our dashboards, not because I thought it was important but because <em>they did</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Annoyingly, I not sure I know what made the difference. I really want to figure it out so I can take advantage of it well. I'm surrounded by amazing people and finding that wonderfully motivating.</p>

<p>### Open Source</p>

<p>A brief aside about working on open source software. An unexpected (for me) side-effect has been how incredible it is to be able to share exactly what I mean when talking to people about software. "I think it is good to do X" becomes "Here's a PR (or set of them) that I think demonstrate a way to do X well".</p>

<p>I think that's awesome.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes in remote work I miss the power of someone looking over your shoulder while you work. It's way harder to cut corners when someone is watching. Remembering that anyone can watch my work helps remind me to take the step from <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">"make it work" to then "make it right"</a></p>

<!--alex ignore simple -->

<p>For example, I fixed a bunch of bugs in our dashboards product (I think more than I introduced 😅). In doing that we learned about what made it easier to introduce those bugs than to avoid them. I could have moved back on to my main priority… but the world is watching, so I figured out a way to make it harder to introduce the bugs than to avoid them (<a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?XpSimplicityRules">"four rules of simple design"</a> for the win) <a href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/13630">https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/13630</a></p>

<h1 id="kids">Kids</h1>

<p><img src="/images/2022-family.jpg" alt="toddle and dog sitting on a path" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>Since last year notes I've graduated from three kids to four kids. It's still incredible. I'm still always very tired. So amazingly worth it. They have said they don't want to be on social media so I won't mention much here.</p>

<p>And now they're home… so I'm going to publish without editing and procrastinating.</p>

<h1 id="what-writing-this-taught-me-i-want-to-do-in-2023">What writing this taught me I want to do in 2023</h1>

<ul>

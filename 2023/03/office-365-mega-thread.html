     "articleBody":"Between  the  end  of  2019  and  when  I  left  the  Co-op  on  Sep  18th  2021  I  used  Office  365  and  never  found  a  single  redeeming  feature.\n\nWell,  maybe  one,  a  small  set  of  Co-op  employees  had  access  to  slack  and  g-suite  in  Co-op  Digital.  But  in  the  rest  of  Co-op  they  were  using  installed  (i.e.  local  only)  old  versions  of  Office  (without  video-conferencing  and  chat).  For  them,  maybe  Office  365  was  an  improvement  -  and  certainly  it  made  remote  work  during  the  pandemic  possible.\n\nBut  for  me,  it  was  a  constant  source  of  frustration.\n\nI'm  sure  that  there  are  great  people  working  on  Office  with  care  and  attention  but  I  didn't  experience  that.  It  was  like  being  haunted  and  losing  your  mind  all  in  one  go.  I  had  a  habit  of  tooting  my  frustrations.  I'm  aware  of  them  having  been  submitted  as  evidence  in  one  procurement  process.  I  don't  think  they  swung  the  decision.\n\nIf  the  tooter-web  dissappeared  they'd  be  the  one  thing  I  missed  and  so  I've  copied  them  here.\n\n\n\nI  didn't  start  the  thread  until  after  I  had  already  made  several  of  the  toots.  So  the  initial  few  dates  might  appear  out  of  order.  I've  kept  the  order  that  I  added  them  to  the  thread  instead  of  listing  them  in  date  order.\n\n\n        10:20AM  Oct  20,  2019\n        My  life  with  office  365  is  not  richer\n          \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n        3:52  PM  Oct  8,  2019\n        Me  (a  person  at  work):  I'd  like  to  import*  a  calendar\nOffice  365:  \"YOU  MUST  WANT  SPORTS!\"\n\nThis  should  not  be  the  default  behaviour  of  anything\n\n*  I  want  to  view  a  calendar\n          \n        \n                \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n        7:46PM  Sep  26,  2019\n        Interesting  to  learn  that  all  one  time  password  apps  should  behave  the  same  because  it's  described  in  an  RFC...\n\nAnd  yet  Office  365  can  only  use  Microsoft  authenticator\n\n#NewMicrosoft\n\n#VeryStaringFace\n          \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n\n        12:01PM  Oct  18,  2019\n        Hey  @office365  can  you  opensource?

		<p>Between the end of 2019 and when I left the Co-op on Sep 18th 2021 I used Office 365 and never found a single redeeming feature.</p>

<p>Well, maybe one, a small set of Co-op employees had access to slack and g-suite in Co-op Digital. But in the rest of Co-op they were using installed (i.e. local only) old versions of Office (<strong>without video-conferencing and chat</strong>). For them, maybe Office 365 was an improvement - and certainly it made remote work during the pandemic possible.</p>

<p>But for me, it was a constant source of frustration.</p>

<p>I'm sure that there are great people working on Office with care and attention but I didn't <em>experience</em> that. It was like being haunted and losing your mind all in one go. I had a habit of <a href="https://twitter.com/pauldambra/status/1185848202249023488">tooting my frustrations</a>. I'm aware of them having been submitted as evidence in one procurement process. I don't think they swung the decision.</p>

<p>If the tooter-web dissappeared they'd be the one thing I missed and so I've copied them here.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I didn't start the thread until after I had already made several of the toots. So the initial few dates might appear out of order. I've kept the order that I added them to the thread instead of listing them in date order.</p>

    Interesting to learn that all one time password apps should behave the same because it's described in an RFC...<br />

    Every Monday Outlook does a "cute" thing where it recreates a meeting series for me so that I can say I don't go to it anymore.<br />
<br />
It takes maybe 30 seconds. If it's doing that for 1% of employees that's 5 hours a week.<br />
<br />
That'd be 8 weeks FTE over the year. #HiddenCosts

    For weeks now Teams has been "opening" a "notification" window on my Mac. It isn't viewable and only has the effect that I can no longer CMD+Tab to Teams cos that invisible window gets "shown"<br />
<br />
The "fix" is to restart Teams when I notice it<br />
<br />
(lifehack: just close it instead)

    One final disappointment from O3.6<br />
<br />
Because I insist on the unexpected browser choice of Chrome on an Android. I can't join a meeting when I find myself caught away from home.<br />

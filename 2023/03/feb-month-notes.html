<p>How did February go?</p>

<p>In reverse order</p>

<p>I'm still figuring out when Italy #2 will be. I'd love to take daughter #1 to Sicily and then catch the train back up through the country. I can work, she can study, and we can both enjoy the food and culture. Maybe a pipe-dreamâ€¦</p>

<p>0 cycle rides in Feb.</p>

<p>Lots of parenting and responsibilities this month, so very little time for myself. And the bags under my eyes are proof of that ðŸ™ˆ</p>

<h2 id="practice-italian-every-day">Practice Italian every day</h2>

<p>âœ… only a few minutes at a time, but I did it every day.</p>

<p>Still trying to get my Dad to talk to me in Italian habitually. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹</p>

<h2 id="continue-becoming-a-better-engineer-and-team-mate">Continue becoming a better engineer and team-mate</h2>

<p>I've been concentrating on this more this month. We joke a lot about being a group of lone wolves and in sprint planning I was described as "wolfing with everyone". I guess that's a good thing ðŸ˜…</p>

<p>My GCSE physics teacher told us to always start solving a problem with a diagram. This month's work was tricky, slow, and frustrating. But when I took the time to draw a diagram or two, and then go for an accidentally long walk, my brain was prepared, and my subconscious figured out how to make the complicated thing much, much less complicated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2023/03/01/drawing.png" alt="a diagram of the problem I was trying to solve" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>One of my favourite engineering aphorisms is from Kent Beck: <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032">"for each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change"</a>.</p>

<p>This particular piece of work, I had three attempts at that had to be abandoned because of side-effects to the change. By the time I'd simplified it, it was a less than 1-day change. <a href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/14348">Here's an example of one of the pieces of simplication https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/pull/14348</a>.</p>

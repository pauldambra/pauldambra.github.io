     "articleBody":"Since  October  2017  I've  been  keeping  week  notes.  I've  found  them  a  fantastic  tool  to  track  my  focus  and  to  remember  to  reflect  on  success  (or  lack  of  it).  I  didn't  write  them  for  most  of  2020.  When  pandemic  hit  it  seemed  too  self-centered.  I  wish  I'd  kept  them  up  now.\n\nI  wrote  year  notes  last  year.  Surprisingly  that  was  the  only  blog  post  I  wrote  last  year  üò±\n\nHere  are  mine  for  2020‚Ä¶  It  feels  egotistical‚Ä¶  but  it's  intended  to  remind  me  to  reflect.  Hopefully  it's  useful  to  me  in  the  future  even  if  it  isn't  to  anyone  else.\n\n\n\nGoals  from  last  year's  year  notes\n\nand  whether  I  achieved  them  or  not\n\n\n    ‚ùå  decide  what  feedback  loops  I  want  to  shorten\n    ¬Ω  find  others  that  want  to  do  that  and  work  with  them\n    ‚úÖ  expect  to  find  better  ways  of  doing  it  by  including  others\n    ¬Ω  read  about  leadership  and  get  over  myself\n    ¬Ω  make  time  to  write  code  and  find  out  from  the  teams  how  they'd  like  me  to  do  that\n\n    ‚úÖ  figure  out  how  I  can  write  weeknotes  as  easily  without  images  in  twitter  being  the  main  record\n    ‚ùå  move  to  a  place  where  we  regularly  measure  and  report  on  our  work\n    ü§£  speak  face-to-face  with  individuals  instead  of  in  big  meetings\n    ¬Ω  practice  Italian  every  day\n\n    ‚ùìuse  the  unfair  super  power  of  being  a  white,  middle-class,  middle-aged,  straight  man  to  lift  others  up\n    ‚úÖ  10km  running  on  average  over  40  weeks  of  the  year\n    ‚ùå  4  leisurely  cycle  rides\n    ‚ùìput  my  phone  down  and  talk  to  my  kids\n\n\nMaybe  measuring  goals  once  a  year  is  a  bad  way  to  achieve  them  ü§î\n\nRunning  and  Cycling\n\nI  went  for  1  bike  ride.  I  could  easily  have  made  time  to  do  more.\n\nI  ran  644km  in  2020.  That's  12.4km  a  week  on  average.  I'm  really  pleased  with  that.  I  bet  I  wouldn't  have  managed  that  if  it  wasn't  for‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶Lockdown\n\nI  suppose  it  would  be  weird  not  to  mention  lockdown  and  COVID  this  year.  I'm  lucky  to  live  close  to  the  countryside,  in  a  house  with  space,  and  to  have  a  job  I  can  do  remotely.  Not  everyone  is  that  lucky  but  lockdown  has  been  nice  for  me.  Instead  of  2  hours  a  day  crammed  on  a  train  I've  seen  my  family,  played  the  guitar,  or  walked  the  dog.\n\n\n\nBecause  I'm  in  the  house  I  could  help  with  the  kids  more.  We  realised  that  because  I  could  do  the  school  run  my  wife  could  work  more.\n\nIt's  definitely  affected  the  \"speak  face-to-face\"  with  individuals  goal  ü§£.  But  I've  been  for  a  walk  a  couple  of  times  with  colleagues  who  live  nearby  and  both  times  that  was  golden.\n\nWorking  remotely  has  been  pretty  great  despite  a  background  of  massively  increased  anxiety.  Given  I  shouldn't  expect  to  live  every  year  with  the  worries  of  this  one  I  think  I'm  sold.\n\nBeing  a  Principal  Engineer\n\nI'm  still  uncomfortable  with  saying  I'm  a  leader.  Less  so  than  in  the  past.  But  I  think  it's  because  culturally  we  have  a  hierarchical  view  where  the  leader  is  important  and  has  all  the  power  and  ideas.  I  don't  think  I  behave  like  that.  I  certainly  try  not  to.  I  can  see  the  pressure  towards  and  ease  of  becoming  an  ivory  tower  architect.\n\nIn  a  world  where  the  leader  is  there  to  help,  to  have  a  wider  viewpoint,  to  join  things  together,  and  to  lift  people  up,  then  I'm  not  uncomfortable.  Then  I'm  scared.  That  sounds  hard.  It  is  hard.\n\nIn  2020  I  worked  with  the  Co-operate,  and  the  Customer  &amp;  Member  teams  and  we  all  contributed  to  a  \"membership  evolution\"  programme.  You  can  read  about  what  we  achieved  in  our  end-of-year  blogpost.  That  meant  I  was  working  across  five  teams  and  with  a  programme  group.  At  times  it  was  too  much.\n\nDoing  too  much\n\nCOVID  massively  reduced  what  we  were  asked  to  do.  That  was  such  a  gift.\n\nAs  a  result  of  doing  less  we  did  things  better.  We  did  (probably)  the  important  things.  And  at  the  end  of  it  all  we  still  celebrated.  We  still  achieved  goals.  Nobody  was  mourning  the  missed  things.  The  company  turned  a  profit.\n\nEvery  year  we  should  routinely  chop  a  third  out  of  what  we  aim  to  do.  (obvs  people  would  start  to  include  sacrificial  work  to  game  the  system  but‚Ä¶)\n\nContext,  direction,  and  measurement\n\nI  need  to  get  better  at  clarifying  and  measuring  things.  And  at  talking  to  people  about  that.  My  colleague  Nathan  Langley  was  incredible  at  that  this  year.  They  stuck  at  it.  From  day-to-day  influencing,  to  rolling  their  sleeves  up  and  making  prototypes,  months  locked  in  a  room  working  to  make  things  better.  Finally  pushing  through  adoption  of  a  way  of  communicating  strategy  and  vision  and  linking  them  to  concrete  activities.  Such  a  cool  thing.  And  now  other  teams  are  picking  it  up.  It  is  scary  how  rare  it  is  for  people  to  communicate  the  basics.  And  it's  amazing  how  powerful  it  is.\n\n\n\nFor  most  of  my  time  on  Membership  there  was  no  communicated  and  agreed  vision.  Many  of  us  believed  we  knew  what  it  was,  some  of  us  even  agreed.  But  we  couldn't  write  it  down  and  point  at  it.  Nate  changed  that.  üî•üíñ  (like,  loads  of  people  were  involved  but  he  was  influential  and  consistent)\n\nI'm  joining  a  new  team  in  the  new  year.  Finding  a  way  to  orient  myself,  choose  action,  and  check  the  outcome  is  still  going  to  be  as  important.  But  will  be  even  more  in  a  new  (to  me)  business  where  I  don't  have  years  of  context.\n\nI  need  to  remember  it's  new  to  me‚Ä¶  not  to  the  folk  already  there.  I'll  bring  my  perspective  but  before  that  I  need  to  bring  my  ears\n\n(which  is  a  clunky  way  of  saying  I  need  to  remember  to  listen)\n\nA  slight  aside  to  say  what  I  think  \"the  basics\"  are\n\n\n    Why  would  I  start?\n    When  do  I  stop?\n    How  do  I  know  it  is  working?\n\n\nI  see  so  much  work  that  can't  answer  those  questions.  Any  framework  or  process  that  doesn't  remind  you  to  answer  those  questions  should  be  yeeted  into  the  sea.\n\nI  love  the  accelerate  metrics.\n\n\n    lead  time,\n    deployment  frequency,\n    mean  time  to  restore  (MTTR)\n    and  change  fail  percentage\n\n\nBut  if  you're  not  measuring  value  then  you  don't  need  the  accelerate  metrics.  They  might  help  you  do  the  wrong  thing  faster.\n\n\n\nBlack  lives  matter\n\nSupporting  and  growing  inclusion  is  the  most  important  thing  I  can  do\n\n\n\nThis  year  was  already  raw.  And  then  George  Floyd  was  murdered  by  the  police  in  America  and  something  broke.  He  wasn't  the  first  or  last  person  killed  by  America's  racist  system  but  something  caught  fire.  Doing  nothing,  saying  nothing  wasn't  ok.  I  said  something  about  it  at  our  weekly  show  and  tell.  I  wanted  folk  on  the  team  to  know  that  their  BAME  colleagues  hurting  and  for  those  BAME  colleagues  to  know  that  if  they  needed  time  or  support  we'd  try  to  help  them.  It  was  the  hardest  public  speaking  I've  ever  done.\n\n\n\nA  couple  of  times  over  the  last  few  years  I've  been  asked  to  come  to  a  meeting  to  repeat  something  a  woman  has  been  trying  to  have  heard  with  my  man-voice  so  people  will  hear  it.  I'd  not  given  the  feedback  to  the  people  not  listening.  I  promised  myself  I'd  used  up  my  feeling-too-awkward-to-say-something  credit  and  the  next  time  I  saw  misogyny  or  exclusion  I'd  say  something.  And  the  next  time  I  saw  misogyny  it  was  on  a  call  with  hundreds  of  other  people.  So,  I  said  something‚Ä¶  I  nearly  didn't  because  I  wasn't  comfortable.  Luckily  I  was  able  to  \"say  something\"  with  text  which  made  it  easier.  But  I'm  glad  I  did.  It  was  the  right  thing  to  do.\n\nI'm  not  claiming  some  expertise  or  moral  high  ground  on  this.  I'm  sharing  some  of  the  small  things  that  I  have  done  cos  I  want  a  world  where  we  all  do  the  small  things.  They  add  up  to  impact  if  enough  people  do  them.\n\nI  know  I'm  not  doing  enough,  I  know  I  need  to  learn  more,  you  almost  certainly  need  to  as  well.\n\nThings  I've  thought  about  more  thoroughly  than  this  blog  post\n\nSince  I  joined  Co-op  I've  worked  on  Membership.  I've  been  there  three  and  a  half  years.  This  year  I  move  to  work  with  Funeralcare.  This  year  has  been  characterised  by  knowing  that  I  was  likely  to  move  but  not  when  or  where  to.  Figuring  out  how  to  work  so  that  the  things  important  to  me  might  carry  on  when  I'm  not  there  is  hard.\n\nI'll  be  watching  to  see  what  happens  and  trying  not  to  judge  myself  too  harshly\n\nThere  are  two  bits  of  writing  as  a  result  of  leaving  membership  that  it  felt  right  to  record  here\n\ntooting  about  my  time  on  membership\n\nI  tooted  a  twoot-thread  at  the  end  of  the  year.\n\nThat  text  is  copied  here  for  \"posterity\"‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nToday's  my  last  day  on  Membership  at  Coop  Digital.  After  three  and  a  half  years  I  move  to  funeralcare  in  the  new  year.  I  thought  I'd  reflect  on  my  time‚Ä¶\n\nlines  of  code  is  a  terrible  metric:  was  the  opinion  I  held  until  I  checked  and  discovered  that  since  July  2017  I've  deleted  more  code  than  I've  added.  Overall,  I've  deleted  1.5  million  lines  of  code.  That  makes  me  happy  even  though  I  know  it's  a  terrible  metric\n\nKindness  and  empathy  are  key.  When  I've  got  that  right  it's  been  üíØ.  When  I've  got  it  wrong  it's  been  üí©\n\nThis  year  we  made  600  changes,  at  a  higher  change  success  rate,  and  with  better  availability.  And  the  systems  we  built  and  work  we  did  had  more  value  for  the  business.  We've  more  than  doubled  the  rate  we  deploy  changes  over  the  last  few  years\n\nWe  used  to  have  very  slow  deploy  pipelines  and  joke  we  could  deploy  in-between  visits  to  our  sites.  In  an  emergency  we  can  now  get  (some)  changes  tested  and  to  prod  in  minutes.  And  we  have  hundreds  of  thousands  of  active  users\n\nI  still  feel  a  bit  uncomfortable  thinking  of  myself  as  a  leader  but  I'm  not  (completely)  scared  of  it  any  more.  Maybe  time  to  stop  winging  it  and  learn  something.  I'm  lucky  to  have  great  peers  to  learn  from\n\n\n\nI'm  increasingly  convinced  that  giving  positive  feedback  is  a  super  power,  and  that  it  pays  back  much  more  than  negative  feedback.  But  I  can  see  times  where  I've  avoided  giving  negative  feedback  and  things  have  been  much  harder  than  just  having  the  \"difficult  conversation\"\n\nshutting  up  and  asking  questions  is  really  hard  (for  me).  knowing  when  to  stop  asking  questions  and  make  statements  is  even  harder.  But  the  times  when  I've  got  that  balance  right  have  been  incredible\n\nTwice  in  the  last  few  years  people  have  told  me  they  feel  safe  on  the  team.  Very  few  things  feel  as  good  as  that\n\nOnce  someone  was  brave  and  told  me  how  I  was  achieving  my  goals  made  their  job  harder.

		<p>Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pauldambra/status/916336773566992384">October 2017</a> I've been keeping week notes. I've found them a fantastic tool to track my focus and to remember to reflect on success (or lack of it). I didn't write them for most of 2020. When pandemic hit it seemed too self-centered. I wish I'd kept them up now.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="/2020/01/year-notes.html">year notes last year</a>. Surprisingly that was the only blog post I wrote last year üò±</p>

<p>Here are mine for 2020‚Ä¶ It feels egotistical‚Ä¶ but it's intended to remind me to reflect. Hopefully it's useful to me in the future even if it isn't to anyone else.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="goals-from-last-years-year-notes">Goals from last year's year notes</h1>

<p>and whether I achieved them or not</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚ùå decide what feedback loops I want to shorten</li>
  <li>¬Ω find others that want to do that and work with them</li>
  <li>‚úÖ expect to find better ways of doing it by including others</li>
  <li>¬Ω read about leadership and get over myself</li>
  <li>¬Ω make time to write code and find out from the teams how they'd like me to do that
<!--alex ignore easy--></li>
  <li>‚úÖ figure out how I can write weeknotes as easily without images in twitter being the main record</li>
  <li>‚ùå move to a place where we regularly measure and report on our work</li>
  <li>ü§£ speak face-to-face with individuals instead of in big meetings</li>
  <li>¬Ω practice Italian every day
<!--alex ignore white--></li>
  <li>‚ùìuse the unfair super power of being a white, middle-class, middle-aged, straight man to lift others up</li>
  <li>‚úÖ 10km running on average over 40 weeks of the year</li>
  <li>‚ùå 4 leisurely cycle rides</li>
  <li>‚ùìput my phone down and <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnnoNolan/status/1208046191906185216">talk to my kids</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe measuring goals once a year is a bad way to achieve them ü§î</p>

<h1 id="running-and-cycling">Running and Cycling</h1>

<p>I went for 1 bike ride. I could easily have made time to do more.</p>

<p>I ran 644km in 2020. That's 12.4km a week on average. I'm <em>really</em> pleased with that. I bet I wouldn't have managed that if it wasn't for‚Ä¶</p>

<h1 id="lockdown">‚Ä¶Lockdown</h1>

<p>I suppose it would be weird not to mention lockdown and COVID this year. I'm lucky to live close to the countryside, in a house with space, and to have a job I can do remotely. Not everyone is that lucky but lockdown has been nice for me. Instead of 2 hours a day crammed on a train I've seen my family, played the guitar, or walked the dog.</p>

<!--alex ignore husband-wife-->

<p>Because I'm in the house I could help with the kids more. We realised that because I could do the school run my wife could work more.</p>

<p>It's definitely affected the "speak face-to-face" with individuals goal ü§£. But I've been for a walk a couple of times with colleagues who live nearby and both times that was golden.</p>

<p>Working remotely has been pretty great despite a background of massively increased anxiety. Given I shouldn't expect to live every year with the worries of this one I think I'm sold.</p>

<h1 id="being-a-principal-engineer">Being a Principal Engineer</h1>

<p>I'm still uncomfortable with saying I'm a leader. Less so than in the past. But I think it's because culturally we have a hierarchical view where the leader is important and has all the power and ideas. I don't <em>think</em> I behave like that. I certainly try not to. I can see the pressure towards and ease of becoming an ivory tower architect.</p>

<p>In a world where the leader is there to help, to have a wider viewpoint, to join things together, and to lift people up, then I'm not uncomfortable. Then I'm scared. That sounds hard. It <em>is</em> hard.</p>

<p>In 2020 I worked with the Co-operate, and the Customer &amp; Member teams and we all contributed to a "membership evolution" programme. You can read about what we achieved in <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/">our end-of-year blogpost</a>. That meant I was working across five teams and with a programme group. At times it was too much.</p>

<h1 id="doing-too-much">Doing too much</h1>

<p>COVID massively reduced what we were asked to do. That was <em>such a gift</em>.</p>

<p>As a result of doing less we did things better. We did (probably) the important things. And at the end of it all we still celebrated. We still achieved goals. Nobody was mourning the missed things. The company turned a profit.</p>

<p>Every year we should routinely chop a third out of what we aim to do. (obvs people would start to include sacrificial work to game the system but‚Ä¶)</p>

<h1 id="context-direction-and-measurement">Context, direction, and measurement</h1>

<p>I need to get better at clarifying and measuring things. And at talking to people about that. My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/_digin8">Nathan Langley</a> was <em>incredible</em> at that this year. They stuck at it. From day-to-day influencing, to rolling their sleeves up and making prototypes, months locked in a room working to make things better. Finally pushing through adoption of a way of communicating strategy and vision and linking them to concrete activities. Such a cool thing. And now other teams are picking it up. It is scary how rare it is for people to communicate the basics. And it's amazing how powerful it is.</p>

<!--alex ignore he-she-->

<p>For most of my time on Membership there was no communicated and agreed vision. Many of us believed we knew what it was, some of us even agreed. But we couldn't write it down and point at it. Nate changed that. üî•üíñ (like, loads of people were involved but he was influential and consistent)</p>

<p>I'm joining a new team in the new year. Finding a way to orient myself, choose action, and check the outcome is still going to be as important. But will be even more in a new (to me) business where I don't have years of context.</p>

<p>I need to remember it's new to me‚Ä¶ not to the folk already there. I'll bring my perspective but before that I need to bring my ears</p>

<p>(which is a clunky way of saying I need to remember to listen)</p>

<h2 id="a-slight-aside-to-say-what-i-think-the-basics-are">A slight aside to say what I think "the basics" are</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Why would I start?</li>
  <li>When do I stop?</li>
  <li>How do I know it is working?</li>
</ul>

<p>I see so much work that can't answer those questions. Any framework or process that doesn't remind you to answer those questions should be yeeted into the sea.</p>

<p>I love <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35747076-accelerate">the accelerate metrics</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>lead time,</li>
  <li>deployment frequency,</li>
  <li>mean time to restore (MTTR)</li>
  <li>and change fail percentage</li>
</ul>

<p>But if you're not measuring value then you don't need the accelerate metrics. They might help you <a href="/2018/01/direction.html">do the wrong thing faster</a>.</p>

<!--alex ignore black-->

<h1 id="black-lives-matter">Black lives matter</h1>

<p>Supporting and growing inclusion is the most important thing I can do</p>

<!--alex ignore racist he-she killed-->

<p>This year was already raw. And then George Floyd was murdered by the police in America and something broke. He wasn't the first or last person killed by America's racist system but something caught fire. Doing nothing, saying nothing wasn't ok. I said something about it at our weekly show and tell. I wanted folk on the team to know that their BAME colleagues hurting and for those BAME colleagues to know that if they needed time or support we'd try to help them. It was the hardest public speaking I've ever done.</p>

<!--alex ignore gal-guy-->

<p>A couple of times over the last few years I've been asked to come to a meeting to repeat something a woman has been trying to have heard with my man-voice so people will hear it. I'd not given the feedback to the people not listening. I promised myself I'd used up my feeling-too-awkward-to-say-something credit and the next time I saw misogyny or exclusion I'd say something. And the next time I saw misogyny it was on a call with hundreds of other people. So, I said something‚Ä¶ I nearly didn't because I wasn't comfortable. Luckily I was able to "say something" with text which made it easier. But I'm glad I did. It was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>I'm not claiming some expertise or moral high ground on this. I'm sharing some of the small things that I have done cos I want a world where we all do the small things. They add up to impact if enough people do them.</p>

<p>I know I'm not doing enough, I know I need to learn more, you almost certainly need to as well.</p>

<h1 id="things-ive-thought-about-more-thoroughly-than-this-blog-post">Things I've thought about more thoroughly than this blog post</h1>

<p>Since I joined Co-op I've worked on Membership. I've been there three and a half years. This year I move to work with Funeralcare. This year has been characterised by knowing that I was likely to move but not when or where to. Figuring out how to work so that the things important to me might carry on when I'm not there is hard.</p>

<p>I'll be watching to see what happens and trying not to judge myself too harshly</p>

<p>There are two bits of writing as a result of leaving membership that it felt right to record here</p>

<h2 id="tooting-about-my-time-on-membership">tooting about my time on membership</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/pauldambra/status/1342070865253556225">tooted a twoot-thread</a> at the end of the year.</p>

<p>That text is copied here for "posterity"‚Ä¶</p>

<hr />

<p>Today's my last day on Membership at Coop Digital. After three and a half years I move to funeralcare in the new year. I thought I'd reflect on my time‚Ä¶</p>

<p>lines of code is a terrible metric: was the opinion I held until I checked and discovered that since July 2017 I've deleted more code than I've added. Overall, I've deleted 1.5 <em>million</em> lines of code. That makes me happy even though I know it's a terrible metric</p>

<p>Kindness and empathy are key. When I've got that right it's been üíØ. When I've got it wrong it's been üí©</p>

<p>This year we made 600 changes, at a higher change success rate, and with better availability. And the systems we built and work we did had more value for the business. We've more than doubled the rate we deploy changes over the last few years</p>

<p>We used to have very slow deploy pipelines and joke we could deploy in-between visits to our sites. In an emergency we can now get (some) changes tested and to prod in minutes. And we have hundreds of thousands of active users</p>

<p>I still feel a bit uncomfortable thinking of myself as a leader but I'm not (completely) scared of it any more. Maybe time to stop winging it and learn something. I'm lucky to have great peers to learn from</p>

<!--alex ignore just-->

<p>I'm increasingly convinced that giving positive feedback is a super power, and that it pays back much more than negative feedback. But I can see times where I've avoided giving negative feedback and things have been much harder than just having the "difficult conversation"</p>

<p>shutting up and asking questions is really hard (for me). knowing when to stop asking questions and make statements is even harder. But the times when I've got that balance right have been incredible</p>

<p>Twice in the last few years people have told me they feel safe on the team. Very few things feel as good as that</p>

<p>Once someone was brave and told me how I was achieving my goals made their job harder. That didn't feel good, but I value it as much, if not more</p>

<!--alex ignore just-->

<p>leadership (maybe just how I do it) magnifies your reach but so also your mistakes. A bad decision I made in Jan of 2018 is still sat in need of defuckulation now. It's hard not to obsess about those mistakes</p>

<p>Building a culture of celebration and sharing is really hard and really, really important</p>

<p>Drawing diagrams is a super power.</p>

<p>The best thing has been learning how much I still have to learn. I had no idea what I was getting into when I took the Principal role, how hard the shift would be from working in a team to working with teams. I'm so glad I did it, I'm so proud of what the teams have achieved</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="slacking-about-my-time-on-membership">slacking about my time on Membership</h2>

<p>I wrote some words in our slack channel when I left the membership team (which I can't completely recreate here cos of secrets and intrigue)</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="keep-up-the-kindness">keep up the kindness</h3>

<p>When someone does something well, tell them.
When you wish someone had done something better, tell them.
When someone breaks something, tell them it‚Äôs ok, tell them about when you broke something. Have I told you about the time I deleted the record of every insurance sale at The BMC?</p>

<p>We have to have a job, it‚Äôs up to us to make sure we enjoy it</p>

<h3 id="people-and-interactions-over-process-and-tools">people and interactions over process and tools</h3>

<p>Process isn‚Äôt a good in and of itself. scrum, kanban, user stories, squads, and more are all attempts by people to describe what worked for them. There‚Äôs a risk you‚Äôre taking advice from a pastry chef while making a casserole.</p>

<p>We should be <em>being</em> agile not <em>doing</em> it.</p>

<h3 id="keep-releasing-small-pieces-of-things">keep releasing small pieces of things</h3>

<p>We made almost a third of Co-op Digital‚Äôs recorded changes in 2020, at higher availability, and with better success than the years before. There are few engineering practices more effective than ensuring that changes to code and config make it, <strong>safely</strong>, to production in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Aim for minutes from commit to prod! What is needed to make that possible?!</p>

<p>The things you need to do to make this possible are what good engineering is.</p>

<h3 id="slow-down">Slow down</h3>

<p>I see us regularly spend all week smashing out feature work. It‚Äôs wonderful that we‚Äôre committed to what we‚Äôre working on. But we have to force ourselves to make time for socialising, learning, and tidying up.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a good chance we‚Äôre moving faster than sponsors, users, and the team can maintain. It‚Äôs time to slow down a little and find a more sustainable pace. You have to weed the garden as well as growing plants.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve seen over the last year folk giving the teams space to make things in the right way. It‚Äôs on us to take that time and use it well.</p>

<h3 id="take-part-in-service-and-support">Take part in service and support</h3>

<p>Our work is not only about making great things, it‚Äôs about keeping them great. Learning from and reacting to what really happens is a super power</p>

<h3 id="take-part-in-design">Take part in design</h3>

<!--alex ignore simple-->

<p>We have an incredible design team. If you haven‚Äôt worked somewhere that doesn‚Äôt value design you might not realise what a wonderful gift it is. Take every opportunity to work with the designers in the team. When there‚Äôs user research go along and take notes. Ask them about the designs. The nuance and depth that goes into seemingly simple things is fascinating and can help you understand why you should put in the extra effort (cos sometimes that detail is <em>hard</em> engineering)</p>

<p>There aren‚Äôt many investments guaranteed to pay back but this is one that will pay back.</p>

<h3 id="keep-being-amazing">Keep being amazing</h3>

<p>3 or 4 years ago Membership systems broke frequently, cost Co-op money, and were an isolated island of functionality. Now we‚Äôre rock solid at 10x usual traffic, turn a profit, and support some of the most important things Co-op are working on.</p>

<p>I hope it‚Äôs not egotistical to say that I know I contributed to that and feel pride in what we‚Äôve achieved. But I know that you all contributed to it far more than I did. I‚Äôm so excited to see where you go from here.</p>

<p>All three kids have said they don't want to be on social media so I won't mention much here. I continue to be amazed that my bad influence isn't reducing the kids well-rounded, excitement at the world.</p>

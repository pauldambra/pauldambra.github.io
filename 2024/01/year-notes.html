     "articleBody":"I  wrote  year  notes  for  2019,  and  2020,  and  2022.  I  remain  super  un-inspired  to  write  over  the  last  few  years.  Which  is  a  shame  -  because  it's  a  a  great  way  to  learn.  Although  7  posts  in  2023  isn't  as  few  as  I  expected.\n\n\n\nGoals  I  chose  for  2023\n\nand  whether  I  achieved  them  or  not\n\n\n    continue  becoming  a  better  engineer  and  team-mate  🧐\n    practice  Italian  every  day  🥑\n    train  at  the  gym  at  least  twice  a  week  every  week  🌓\n    8  leisurely  cycle  rides  ❌\n    visit  Italy  at  least  twice  ✅\n\n\nvisit  Italy  at  least  twice  ✅\n\n\n\nI  spent  an  amazing  week  in  Anzio  (near  Rome)  in  spring  for  a  family  holiday.  And  a  differently  amazing  week  in  Bologna  in  the  winter  for  work.\n\nAnzio  was  particularly  great  because  the  folk  that  live  there  didn't  speak  English.  So,  I  had  to  speak  Italian.  Proving  I  have  graduated  from  \"Hangry  three  year  old\"  to  \"Precocious  three  year  old\".  A  highlight  was  the  owner  of  a  pizza  place  complimenting  my  Italian.\n\n8  leisurely  cycle  rides  ❌\n\nI  took  0  rides.  I'm  not  super  sure  how  I'd  fit  this  into  my  life  right  now.  Maybe  this  shouldn't  be  a  goal.  I  love  cycling,  I  don't  love  cycling  around  British  drivers.\n\ntrain  at  the  gym  at  least  twice  a  week  every  week  🌓\n\nOverall,  I  averaged  a  day  a  week  at  the  gym.  From  January  to  July  I  averaged  twice  a  week.  But  the  rest  of  the  year  was  tricky.\n\nThis  has  been  great…  I  didn't  think  I'd  enjoy  it.  But,  having  time  to  listen  to  podcasts  &amp;  audio  books,  and  to  watch  Italian  TV  has  been  amazing.  I'm  stronger  than  I've  ever  been  (I'm  not  confused  about  how  strong  other  people  are  relative  to  me  (much  stronger),  but  I'm  not  in  competition  with  other  people.  I'm  in  competition  with  myself).\n\nWhy  concentrate  on  being  stronger..?  Maybe,  because  I'm  not  any  lighter  :/\n\npractice  Italian  every  day  🥑\n\nAnother  half  achieved.  I've  done  a  lot  of  practice,  I'm  better  at  Italian  than  I  was…  but  I'm  not  being  purposeful  or  consistent  about  it.\n\nI  think  this  (like  cycling)  is  about  finding  a  way  to  fit  it  into  my  life.  To  some  extent  I  need  to  be  gentle  with  myself  -  we  have  a  2  year  old  and  that  is  a  ridonculous  amount  of  work.  Some  of  these  things  will  be  way  easier  in  2  years  time.\n\nBut  I  don't  want  to  wait  2  years  :/\n\ncontinue  becoming  a  better  engineer  and  team-mate  🧐\n\n2023  was  an  awesome  year  of  work.  I've  worked  on  some  of  the  hardest  things  I've  ever  worked  on  with  some  genuinely  amazing  people.  I've  done  good  work,  and  I've  achieved  things.  I'm  going  to  be  stepping  up  as  team  lead  in  2024  and  I'm  super  excited  about  that.  We  work  on  a  wicked  product  with  a  great  team.  We're  on  the  verge  of  releasing  some  awesome  things.  I'm  super  lucky.\n\nBut  the  imposter  syndrome  has  been  going  hard  this  year.  It's  frustrating  to  still  have  my  inner  voice  undercutting  me.\n\nI  like  pairing  things  up  so  they  are  in  tension  with  each  other…\n\nSeneca  said  \"Difficulty  comes  from  our  lack  of  confidence.\"\n\nAnd  Bertrand  Russel  said  \"One  of  the  painful  things  about  our  time  is  that  those  who  feel  certainty  are  stupid,  and  those  with  any  imagination  and  understanding  are  filled  with  doubt  and  indecision.\"\n\nIt's  a  good  tension…  I  want  to  bring  confidence  in  my  work,  but  I  want  to  temper  that  with  humility  and  doubt.  I  need  to  do  what  I'd  advise  someone  else  to  do  and  track  what  I'm  really  achieving  and  respond  to  that.  Otherwise  there's  no  way  to  know  what's  imposter  syndrome  and  what's  my  subconscious  prompting  me  to  take  a  second  look  at  something.\n\nWhat  was  2023  like?\n\nIt  would  be  weirdly  coy  to  write  this  and  not  say  that  2023  was  defined  by  grief.  The  realisation  that  grief  would  be  coming,  the  lost  months  waiting,  and  then  the  grief  itself.  I've  lost  people  before  but  nobody  so  close.  Some  combination  of  circumstances  has  meant  it  has  cut  so  much  deeper  this  time.\n\n2023  very  much  felt  like  two  years.  The  year  before  we  knew  grief  was  coming,  and  the  year  after.  Despite  that  I  really  enjoyed  the  journey  this  year.  I  feel  happier  in  myself.\n\n#4  daughter  still  says  \"stankyou\"  instead  of  \"thank  you\"  and  I'm  going  to  be  horribly  sad  when  she  stops.\n\nIt  is  cliche  but  this  year  has  made  me  wonder  what  I  hope  to  be  able  to  say  on  my  death  bed  when  asked  \"what  was  your  life  like?\".\n\nTravel\n\nIn  2023  I  visited  2  countries  (I'm  not  counting  the  UK,  and  I'm  not  counting  the  few  hours  I  spent  in  Schipol  airport  as  a  trip  to  Holland  😊).\n\n\n\n\n    Aruba\n        \n            for  the  whole  company  off-site\n        \n    \n    Anzio,  Italy\n        \n            for  a  family  holiday\n        \n    \n    Bologna,  Italy\n        \n            for  a  team  off-site\n        \n    \n\n\nAruba  was  amazing,  astounding,  and  awesome  (all  the  As).  For  weeks  beforehand  I  couldn't  help  crow-barring  that  we  were  going  into  every  conversation.  It  was  beautiful.\n\nAt  our  whole  company  off-site  we  have  a  hackathon.  And  so,  we  were  all  working  in  the  bar  at  an  all-inclusive  resort.  A  woman  from  a  recently  arrived  cruise  ship  came  over:  \"I  have  to  ask…  what  kind  of  job  do  you  all  have  that  you're  working  in  a  bar  in  Aruba?\".\n\nWork\n\nA  couple  of  times  I'd  said  \"We  need  to  understand  Kafka  and  ClickHouse  better\".\n\n\n\nA  monkey's  paw  somewhere  kicked  in,  and  I  spent  a  lot  of  time  this  year  working  with  the  sharper  edges  of  Kafka  and  ClickHouse.  We  saved  money,  made  things  faster,  and  made  things  more  reliable.  Which  let  us  improve  the  product.\n\nI  now  understand  Kafka  and  ClickHouse  well  enough  to  be  truly  afraid  of  how  little  I  know  about  them  🤣\n\nIn  Rome  in  2022  I  got  the  feedback  (roughly)  \"you  spend  a  lot  of  time  spinning  plates,  and  worrying  about  it,  but  you're  pretty  good  at  it,  maybe  you  should  stop  worrying  about  it,  and  get  better  at  it\"…  That  really  resonated  with  me,  and  I've  been  trying  to  do  that.\n\nIn  Bologna  in  2023  I  got  the  feedback  \"you're  the  king  of  distractions\".  There  is  still  always  the  risk  of  having  too  much  work-in-progress  and  not  finishing  things  but  letting  myself  admit  that  my  mind  works  better  with  a  higher  personal  WIP  limit  has  been  great.\n\nI  also  got  the  feedback  that  I'd  done  some  things  because  we  could  without  stopping  to  think  enough  about  whether  we  should.  Particularly  since  I'm  stepping  into  the  team  lead  role  I  need  to  think  deeply  about  this  feedback.\n\nAgain  this  year  I've  spent  time  talking  to  customers.  And,  as  always,  it's  been  absolutely  essential  to  how  I've  been  able  to  do  my  job.  I've  not  purposefully  focussed  on  this  -  other  than  knowing  I  want  to  be  doing  it.  I'm  going  to  be  more  purposeful  here…\n\nMe\n\nI've  been  enjoying  cooking.  Food  has  always  been  an  expression  of  love  in  my  life.  I've  got  pretty  good  at  pizza  and  pasta  this  year.  Although  I'm  still  pretty  terrible  at  focaccia.\n\n\n\nMy  favourite  moment  of  2023?\n\nIt  has  to  be  flushing  this  toilet  in  the  modern  art  museum  in  Bologna  to  try  and  figure  out  if  I  was  about  to  relieve  myself  in  a  piece  of  art  or  a  toilet.\n\n\n\nWhat  writing  this  taught  me  I  want  to  do  in  2024\n\nLooking  back  through  photos  and  thinking  over  the  year  made  me  realise  that  every  year  is  longer  than  I  think  it  is  going  to  be…  we  can  fit  a  lot  into  a  year.  And  we  can  miss  a  lot  of  opportunities…\n\nwork\n\n\n    continue  becoming  a  better  engineer  and  team-mate\n    take  more  time  to  lift  my  head  up  and  look  at  the  horizon\n    get  better  at  digging  into  tricky  problems\n    get  better  at  not  being  distracted  by  tricky  problems  if  there  is  some  higher  value  work  I  should  be  doing\n    speak  to  customers  for  at  least  5  hours  over  the  year\n\n\nhome\n\n\n    more  time  with  my  family  (screens  off,  not  watching  telly)\n    solidify  my  transactional  Italian,  figure  out  how  to  head  towards  conversational  Italian\n    train  at  the  gym  at  least  twice  a  week  every  week  (and  lose  weight)\n    visit  Italy  at  least  twice\n\n"

<p>I spent an amazing week in Anzio (near Rome) in spring for a family holiday. And a differently amazing week in Bologna in the winter for work.</p>

<p>Anzio was particularly great because the folk that live there didn't speak English. So, I had to speak Italian. Proving I have graduated from "Hangry three year old" to "Precocious three year old". A highlight was the owner of a pizza place complimenting my Italian.</p>

<h3 id="8-leisurely-cycle-rides-">8 leisurely cycle rides ❌</h3>

<p>I took 0 rides. I'm not super sure how I'd fit this into my life right now. Maybe this shouldn't be a goal. I love cycling, I don't love cycling around British drivers.</p>

<h3 id="train-at-the-gym-at-least-twice-a-week-every-week-">train at the gym at least twice a week every week 🌓</h3>

<p>Overall, I averaged a day a week at the gym. From January to July I averaged twice a week. But the rest of the year was tricky.</p>

<p>This has been great… I didn't think I'd enjoy it. But, having time to listen to podcasts &amp; audio books, and to watch Italian TV has been amazing. I'm stronger than I've ever been (I'm not confused about how strong other people are relative to me (much stronger), but I'm not in competition with other people. I'm in competition with myself).</p>

<p>Why concentrate on being stronger..? Maybe, because I'm not any lighter :/</p>

<h3 id="practice-italian-every-day-">practice Italian every day 🥑</h3>

<p>Another half achieved. I've done a lot of practice, I'm better at Italian than I was… but I'm not being purposeful or consistent about it.</p>

<p>I think this (like cycling) is about finding a way to fit it into my life. To some extent I need to be gentle with myself - we have a 2 year old and that is a ridonculous amount of work. Some of these things will be way easier in 2 years time.</p>

<p>But I don't want to wait 2 years :/</p>

<h3 id="continue-becoming-a-better-engineer-and-team-mate-">continue becoming a better engineer and team-mate 🧐</h3>

<p>2023 was an awesome year of work. I've worked on some of the hardest things I've ever worked on with some genuinely amazing people. I've done good work, and I've achieved things. I'm going to be stepping up as team lead in 2024 and I'm super excited about that. We work on a wicked product with a great team. We're on the verge of releasing some awesome things. I'm super lucky.</p>

<p>But the imposter syndrome has been going hard this year. It's frustrating to still have my inner voice undercutting me.</p>

<p>I like pairing things up so they are in tension with each other…</p>

<p>Seneca said "Difficulty comes from our lack of confidence."</p>

<p>And Bertrand Russel said "One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision."</p>

<p>It's a good tension… I want to bring confidence in my work, but I want to temper that with humility and doubt. I need to do what I'd advise someone else to do and track what I'm really achieving and respond to that. Otherwise there's no way to know what's imposter syndrome and what's my subconscious prompting me to take a second look at something.</p>

<h1 id="what-was-2023-like">What was 2023 like?</h1>

<p>It would be weirdly coy to write this and not say that 2023 was defined by grief. The realisation that grief would be coming, the lost months waiting, and then the grief itself. I've lost people before but nobody so close. Some combination of circumstances has meant it has cut so much deeper this time.</p>

<p>2023 very much felt like two years. The year before we knew grief was coming, and the year after. Despite that I really enjoyed the journey this year. I feel happier in myself.</p>

<p>#4 daughter still says "stankyou" instead of "thank you" and I'm going to be horribly sad when she stops.</p>

<p>It is cliche but this year has made me wonder what I hope to be able to say on my death bed when asked "what was your life like?".</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p>In 2023 I visited 2 countries (I'm not counting the UK, and I'm not counting the few hours I spent in Schipol airport as a trip to Holland 😊).</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024/01/travel.png" alt="2023 travel map from Google Maps showing the countries and places I visited" loading="lazy" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Aruba
    <ul>
      <li>for the whole company off-site</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Anzio, Italy
    <ul>
      <li>for a family holiday</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bologna, Italy
    <ul>
      <li>for a team off-site</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Aruba was amazing, astounding, and awesome (all the As). For weeks beforehand I couldn't help crow-barring that we were going into every conversation. It was beautiful.</p>

<p>At our whole company off-site we have a hackathon. And so, we were all working in the bar at an all-inclusive resort. A woman from a recently arrived cruise ship came over: "I have to ask… what kind of job do you all have that you're working in a bar in Aruba?".</p>

<h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<p>A couple of times I'd said "We need to understand Kafka and ClickHouse better".</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024/01/monkeys-paw.gif" alt="a monkey's paw" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>A monkey's paw somewhere kicked in, and I spent a lot of time this year working with the sharper edges of Kafka and ClickHouse. We saved money, made things faster, and made things more reliable. Which let us improve the product.</p>

<p>I now understand Kafka and ClickHouse well enough to be truly afraid of how little I know about them 🤣</p>

<p>In Rome in 2022 I got the feedback (roughly) "you spend a lot of time spinning plates, and worrying about it, but you're pretty good at it, maybe you should stop worrying about it, and get better at it"… That really resonated with me, and I've been trying to do that.</p>

<p>In Bologna in 2023 I got the feedback "you're the king of distractions". There is still always the risk of having too much work-in-progress and not finishing things but letting myself admit that my mind works better with a higher personal WIP limit has been great.</p>

<p>I also got the feedback that I'd done some things because we <em>could</em> without stopping to think enough about whether we <em>should</em>. Particularly since I'm stepping into the team lead role I need to think deeply about this feedback.</p>

<p>Again this year I've spent time talking to customers. And, as always, it's been absolutely essential to how I've been able to do my job. I've not purposefully focussed on this - other than knowing I want to be doing it. I'm going to be more purposeful here…</p>

<h1 id="me">Me</h1>

<p>I've been enjoying cooking. Food has always been an expression of love in my life. I've got pretty good at pizza and pasta this year. Although I'm still pretty terrible at focaccia.</p>

<h2 id="my-favourite-moment-of-2023">My favourite moment of 2023?</h2>

<p>It has to be flushing this toilet in the modern art museum in Bologna to try and figure out if I was about to relieve myself in a piece of art or a toilet.</p>

<h1 id="what-writing-this-taught-me-i-want-to-do-in-2024">What writing this taught me I want to do in 2024</h1>

<p>Looking back through photos and thinking over the year made me realise that every year is longer than I think it is going to be… we can fit a lot into a year. And we can miss a lot of opportunities…</p>

   "articleBody":"A  few  years  ago  while  waiting  for  a  user  group  to  start  at  the  Manchester  ThoughtWorks  office  I  bothered  a  couple  of  the  devs  there  about  their  board.  That  conversation,  after  a  bit  of  fangling,  led  to  my  convincing  the  team  I  was  on  at  the  time  to  use  a  radar  board  to  represent  our  backlog.\n\nIt  allowed  us  to  combine  a  fluid  representation  of  the  business's  priorities  with  a  physical  representation  of  the  cost  of  reorganising  those  priorities.  But  also,  in  a  way  you  don't  get  with  a  columnar  board,  gave  an  immediate  feedback  mechanism  when  too  much  work  had  been  proposed  or  accepted.\n\nApologies  to  the  two  ThoughtWorks  devs  if  I  misrepresent  any  of  their  good  ideas  as  mine  or  my  bad  ideas  as  theirs.\n\n\n\nThe  board  was  really  simple.  At  the  top  right  there  was  a  small  quarter  circle  labelled  \"now\".  Then  a  slightly  larger  one  labelled  \"next\".  After  that  a  slightly  larger  one  labelled  whatever  you  like  to  mean  not-next-but-after-that.  We  experimented  with  a  fourth  quadrant  but  it  covered  ground  so  far  away  in  time  that  it  didn't  add  much  distinction  to  the  plan.\n\nBy  chance  I  still  have  a  photo  I  took  as  we  drew  an  early  version  of  the  quadrants  on  the  board.\n\n\n\nYou  can  see  it's  very  straight-forward.\n\nThe  radar  board  had  the  kanban  board  alongside  it  so  you  could  see  work  getting  closer  to  \"now\"  until  it  was  promoted  onto  the  kanban  board.  We  called  it:  radarban\n\n\n\nSeveral  points  here:\n\n\n    I  am  well  known  for  my  incredible  artistic  skills  and  ability  at  writing  clearly.  As  this  diagram  shows.\n    Bugs  are  a  separate  stream  of  work.  You  pull  preferentially  from  that  row  running  across  the  top  of  the  board.\n    The  radar  doesn't  have  to  be  huge.  We  had  room  for  hand-recorded  metrics  alongside.\n    The  'value'  column  is  an  obsession  of  mine.  We  didn't  always  have  it.  We  didn't  really  get  it  to  work.  I  think  it's  probably  the  most  important  thing  most  teams  don't  do.\n\n\nWhat  is  it?!\n\nNow\n\nWhen  there  is  capacity  the  team  commits  to  work  on  something  and  moves  it  into  'Now'.  For  the  team  in  question  that's  when  we'd  have  the  kick-off  meeting  and  split  it  out  into  various  tasks  and  stories  (see  below).\n\nThe  quadrant  represents  in  broad  brushstrokes  (what  some  would  call  'epic'  level)  what  the  team  is  working  on  right,  erm,  now.\n\nIf  someone  has  been  out  of  the  office  they  should  be  able  to  see  at  a  glance  what's  happening.\n\nNext\n\nThe  'Next'  quadrant  is  whatever  the  business  has  prioritised  to  happen  as  soon  as  any  current  piece  of  work  is  signed  off.  Something  getting  into  'Next'  is  not  a  commitment  to  work  on  it.\n\nTracking  cycle  time  let's  you  see  when  the  tickets  in  Next  should  start.\n\nLater  /  Maybe  /  Possibly  /  Probably\n\nThe  third  quadrant  is  weeks  if  not  months  out  (all  depends  on  your  flow).  And  these  tickets  should  be  very  vague  because  items  here  might  never  be  worked  on,  or  might  change  significantly  before  they  start.  If  you're  spending  effort  in  this  part  of  the  board  then  something  is  wrong.\n\nSo  far,  so  exactly  like  a  backlog  column,  right?\n\nWhat  goes  on  it?\n\nEverything  goes  on  this  board.  Recruitment,  holidays,  business  trips,  when  the  new  printer  is  arriving…  (the  list  by  virtue  of  being  everything  could  keep  going).\n\n…  ….  Well,  not  everything,  if  nobody  cares  that  a  particular  thing  is  on  there  stop  putting  it  on.\n\nWhy  a  radar?\n\nPhysical  feedback\n\nThe  'Now'  quadrant  is  small.  Those  three  tickets  in  the  image  above  are  pretty  high-level  and  they're  all  that  will  fit  in  there.  If  somebody  tried  to  add  more  work  to  that  quadrant  they'd  have  to  overlap  tickets,  or  crowd  then  together,  turn  them  sideways…  In  other  words  they  get  immediate,  visceral,  physical  feedback  that  they  are  overloading  the  team.\n\n**  So  it  would  promote  the  conversation  about  the  cost  of  a  change  to  work  in-flight  or  a  higher  load  on  the  team.  **\n\nExpresses  fluidity\n\nIt  seemed  that  there  was  less  mental  barrier  to  reorganising  proposed  work  when  it  was  a  set  of  concentric  clouds  of  tickets  than  when  it  was  a  series  of  columns.\n\nWe  had  two.  whole.  whiteboards.  of.  backlog.  at  one  point  -  guess  how  many  people  cared  about  the  backlog  when  it  was  that  big…  In  contrast  it  was  a  frequent  sight  to  see  the  CEO  and  CTO  stood  by  the  radar  reorganising  the  quadrants  based  on  what  had  changed  for  them  since  it  was  last  looked  at.\n\nBecause  there  wasn't  the  implied  (or  explicit)  priority  of  something  being  at  the  top  of  a  column  of  tickets  we  avoided  effort  prioritising  or  discussing  work  until  we  were  ready  to  move  one  or  more  of  the  tickets  closer  to  'now'.  When  we  were  ready  to  move  a  ticket  we  only  moved  whichever  was  best  right  now.\n\n**  So  it  would  promote  the  conversation  about  what  the  priorities  were.  **\n\nNot  every  idea  is  equal\n\nBacklogs  have  a  tendency  to  attract  ideas  that  will  never  be  worked  on  (for  one  reason  or  another).  Limiting  the  amount  of  space  for  the  backlog.  And  as  a  result  limiting  what  can  go  in  it  forces  you  to  maintain  the  backlog.\n\nKeeping  it  incredibly  low  fidelity  means  people  aren't  invested  in  the  idea  as  much  and  makes  this  process  easier\n\n**  So  it  would  promote  the  conversation  about  whether  we  need  to  or  would  ever  work  on  an  item  **\n\nIt  always  works!\n\nNo,  there  are  no  golden  bullets  (or  boards).\n\nThe  context  where  I  propose  it  helps  is  when  business  priorities  are  fluid,  where  they're  not  clear  to  everyone,  or  where  the  business  doesn't  feel  the  cost  of  changing  work  in-flight.\n\nIt's  ok  for  needs  and  priorities  to  change  but  when  they  change  frequently  making  sure  everybody  knows  what  is  going  on  can  be  very  difficult.\n\nIt's  (sometimes)  OK  to  drop  everything  because  of  emergencies  or  opportunities  but  it  can  also  become  the  norm.  It  can  be  hard  to  notice  that  happening  and  to  communicate  the  cost  of  that  to  the  people  asking  for  the  changes.  Walking  over  to  the  radar  to  say  \"we  can  move  it  in  but  we  have  to  move  something  out\"  helps  clarify  this  and  let's  everyone  make  a  concrete  decision.\n\nKick-off  and  split  -  as  an  aside\n\nThat  'kick-off  and  split'  process  was  moving  us  towards  a  single-piece  flow  approach  introduced  to  us  by  one  of  our  colleagues  Michael  Dickens.  There's  an  example  here  on  Twitter  where  you  can  see  in  the  centre  the  various  tasks  required  to  finish  this  piece  of  work  stuck  over  a  diagram  of  the  moving  pieces.\n\nOr  similarly  described  here  by  Kevin  Rutherford  where  a  diagram  helps  guide  and  frame  the  discussion  of  what  work  needs  doing.\n\nThat  should  give  you  an  idea  of  the  scope  of  the  tickets  in  now.  Up  to  several  pieces  of  work  for  several  developers  for  several  days.\n\nAt  one  point  we  did  erase  the  kanban  board,  draw  a  complex  process  flow  we  needed  to  implement  in  its  place,  and  stick  post-its  over  that.  It  worked  really  well!\n\nWhat  do  you  absolutely  need?\n\nYou  need  lots  of  space.\n\nWe  had  more  than  one  whiteboard  per  person.  So  could  afford  three  boards  to  describe  our  current  and  upcoming  work.  We  were  also  colocated  so  we  didn't  need  an  electronic  board  (although  we  did  have  to  have  one  and  it  was  never  up-to-date  :/)\n\nI've  tried  this  recently  with  a  different  team.  We  have  very  little  whiteboard  space.  We  were  trying  to  convey  a  lot  of  information  in  one  place  -  it  didn't  work  for  everyone  so  we've  moved  away  from  it\n\n\n\nIt's  a  shame  we  couldn't  make  it  work  because  even  with  a  lack  of  space  it  was  great  for  communicating  what  was  coming  towards  the  team,  focussing  on  what  we  were  working  on,  and  promoting  conversation  about  the  things  we  were  doing.\n\nYou  need  to  talk  to  each  other\n\nUltimately  that's  what  this  is  about  -  if  I  haven't  laboured  that  point  enough.\n\nThis  is  a  planning  mechanism  intended  to  force  the  right  people  to  stand  next  to  each  other  and  agree  about  what  is  happening.\n\nIf  you  try  this…\n\n…  I'd  love  to  hear  about  it.\n\nTell  me  what  worked  and  didn't,  send  me  a  picture,  ask  me  questions.\n"

		<p>A few years ago while waiting for a user group to start at the Manchester ThoughtWorks office I bothered a couple of the devs there about their board. That conversation, after a bit of fangling, led to my convincing the team I was on at the time to use a radar board to represent our backlog.</p>

<p>It allowed us to combine a fluid representation of the business's priorities with a physical representation of the cost of reorganising those priorities. But also, in a way you don't get with a columnar board, gave an immediate feedback mechanism when too much work had been proposed or accepted.</p>

<p>Apologies to the two ThoughtWorks devs if I misrepresent any of their good ideas as mine or my bad ideas as theirs.</p>

<!--more-->
<!--alex ignore simple --->
<p>The board was really simple. At the top right there was a small quarter circle labelled "now". Then a slightly larger one labelled "next". After that a slightly larger one labelled whatever you like to mean not-next-but-after-that. We experimented with a fourth quadrant but it covered ground so far away in time that it didn't add much distinction to the plan.</p>

<p>By chance I still have a photo I took as we drew an early version of the quadrants on the board.</p>

<p><img src="/images/radar.jpg" alt="Very early version of the board" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>You can see it's very straight-forward.</p>

<p>The radar board had the kanban board alongside it so you could see work getting closer to "now" until it was promoted onto the kanban board. We called it: radarban</p>

<p><img src="/images/ideal-board.jpg" alt="A diagram showing the board" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>Several points here:
<!--alex ignore clearly ---></p>
<ul>
  <li>I am well known for my incredible artistic skills and ability at writing clearly. As this diagram shows.</li>
  <li>Bugs are a separate stream of work. You pull preferentially from that row running across the top of the board.</li>
  <li>The radar doesn't have to be huge. We had room for hand-recorded metrics alongside.</li>
  <li>The 'value' column is an obsession of mine. We didn't always have it. We didn't really get it to work. I think it's probably the most important thing most teams don't do.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-is-it">What is it?!</h1>

<h3 id="now">Now</h3>

<p>When there is capacity the team commits to work on something and moves it into 'Now'. For the team in question that's when we'd have the kick-off meeting and split it out into various tasks and stories (see below).</p>

<p>The quadrant represents in broad brushstrokes (what some would call 'epic' level) what the team is working on right, erm, now.</p>

<p>If someone has been out of the office they should be able to see at a glance what's happening.</p>

<h3 id="next">Next</h3>

<p>The 'Next' quadrant is whatever the business has prioritised to happen as soon as any current piece of work is signed off. Something getting into 'Next' is not a commitment to work on it.</p>

<p>Tracking cycle time let's you see when the tickets in Next should start.</p>

<h3 id="later--maybe--possibly--probably">Later / Maybe / Possibly / Probably</h3>

<p>The third quadrant is weeks if not months out (all depends on your flow). And these tickets should be very vague because items here might never be worked on, or might change significantly before they start. If you're spending effort in this part of the board then something is wrong.</p>

<p>So far, so exactly like a backlog column, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-goes-on-it">What goes on it?</h2>

<p>Everything goes on this board. Recruitment, holidays, business trips, when the new printer is arriving… (the list by virtue of being everything could keep going).</p>

<p>… …. Well, not everything, if nobody cares that a particular thing is on there stop putting it on.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-radar">Why a radar?</h2>

<h3 id="physical-feedback">Physical feedback</h3>

<p>The 'Now' quadrant is small. Those three tickets in the image above are pretty high-level and they're all that will fit in there. If somebody tried to add more work to that quadrant they'd have to overlap tickets, or crowd then together, turn them sideways… In other words they get immediate, visceral, physical feedback that they are overloading the team.</p>

<p>** So it would promote the conversation about the cost of a change to work in-flight or a higher load on the team. **</p>

<h3 id="expresses-fluidity">Expresses fluidity</h3>
<!--alex ignore nuts --->
<p>It seemed that there was less mental barrier to reorganising proposed work when it was a set of concentric clouds of tickets than when it was a series of columns.</p>

<p>We had <em>two</em>. <em>whole</em>. <em>whiteboards</em>. <em>of</em>. <em>backlog</em>. at one point - guess how many people cared about the backlog when it was that big… In contrast it was a frequent sight to see the CEO and CTO stood by the radar reorganising the quadrants based on what had changed for them since it was last looked at.</p>

<p>Because there wasn't the implied (or explicit) priority of something being at the top of a column of tickets we avoided effort prioritising or discussing work until we were ready to move one or more of the tickets closer to 'now'. When we were ready to move a ticket we only moved whichever was best right now.</p>

<p>** So it would promote the conversation about what the priorities were. **</p>

<h3 id="not-every-idea-is-equal">Not every idea is equal</h3>

<p>Backlogs have a tendency to attract ideas that will never be worked on (for one reason or another). Limiting the amount of space for the backlog. And as a result limiting what can go in it forces you to maintain the backlog.</p>

<p>Keeping it incredibly low fidelity means people aren't invested in the idea as much and makes this process easier</p>

<p>** So it would promote the conversation about whether we need to or would ever work on an item **</p>

<h1 id="it-always-works">It always works!</h1>

<p>No, there are no golden bullets (or boards).</p>

<p>The context where I propose it helps is when business priorities are fluid, where they're not clear to everyone, or where the business doesn't feel the cost of changing work in-flight.</p>

<p>It's ok for needs and priorities to change but when they change frequently making sure everybody knows what is going on can be very difficult.</p>

<p>It's (sometimes) OK to drop everything because of emergencies or opportunities but it can also become the norm. It can be hard to notice that happening and to communicate the cost of that to the people asking for the changes. Walking over to the radar to say "we can move it in but we have to move something out" helps clarify this and let's everyone make a concrete decision.</p>

<h2 id="kick-off-and-split---as-an-aside">Kick-off and split - as an aside</h2>

<p>That 'kick-off and split' process was moving us towards a single-piece flow approach introduced to us by one of our colleagues <a href="https://twitter.com/quezlatch">Michael Dickens</a>. There's an <a href="https://twitter.com/andylongshaw/status/788775269788155904">example here on Twitter</a> where you can see in the centre the various tasks required to finish this piece of work stuck over a diagram of the moving pieces.</p>

<p>Or similarly <a href="https://silkandspinach.net/2017/01/18/evolving-the-kanban-board/">described here by Kevin Rutherford</a> where a diagram helps guide and frame the discussion of what work needs doing.</p>

<p>That should give you an idea of the scope of the tickets in now. Up to several pieces of work for several developers for several days.</p>

<p>At one point we did erase the kanban board, draw a complex process flow we needed to implement in its place, and stick post-its over that. It worked really well!</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-absolutely-need">What do you absolutely need?</h2>

<h3 id="you-need-lots-of-space">You need lots of space.</h3>

<p>We had more than one whiteboard per person. So could afford three boards to describe our current and upcoming work. We were also colocated so we didn't need an electronic board (although we did have to have one and it was never up-to-date :/)</p>

<p>I've tried this recently with a different team. We have very little whiteboard space. We were trying to convey a lot of information in one place - it didn't work for everyone so we've moved away from it</p>

<p><img src="/images/one-board.jpg" alt="All crammed into one board" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>It's a shame we couldn't make it work because even with a lack of space it was great for communicating what was coming towards the team, focussing on what we were working on, and promoting conversation about the things we were doing.</p>

<h3 id="you-need-to-talk-to-each-other">You need to talk to each other</h3>

<p>Ultimately that's what this is about - if I haven't laboured that point enough.</p>

<p>This is a planning mechanism intended to force the right people to stand next to each other and agree about what is happening.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-try-this">If you try this…</h1>

<p>… I'd love to hear about it.</p>

<p>Tell me what worked and didn't, send me a picture, ask me questions.</p>

      <h1> Dear Diary </h1>

<p>
I've fallen into a habit of ending each working week by tweeting a diary entry of my week. And have realised I've kept it up for a year now.
</p>
<p>
It's not very accessible because the entries are images so that I can fit them into a tweet. But it's been really useful for keping track of the positives I (and mostly the people I work with) achieve.
</p>
<p>
  But mostly it's helpful for reflecting on whether I'm doing valuable things and whether they are the things I meant to do each week.
</p>
<p>
  You can <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=from%3Apauldambra%20AND%20%23deardiary&src=typd" target="_blank">follow the entries on twitter</a> but that doesn't feel permanent enough so I've gathered them here.
  </p>

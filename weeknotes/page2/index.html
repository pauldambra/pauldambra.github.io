<p>😥 long week <br />
🌓 how are we half-way through the year <br />
💉 started with second COVID jab <br />
💖 got some awesome, timely support this week <br />
😬 for some scary meetings <br />
😅 which weren't as scary as I worried <br />
😘 some awesome colleagues move off the team this week <br />
👋 and another left entirely <br />
👻 managed to completely break a project with an innocuous change - haunted NPM packages at fault<br />
✅ had fun <br /></p>

<p>🤔 odd week, only three days in work<br />
🤷‍♀️ started with bittersweet news at home <br />
🦷 ended with one of the kids having dental work under general anaesthetic<br />
⌨️ only wrote code for fun this week<br />
🤯 can't get my head around some things at work <br />
💖 principles and empathy is the name of the game<br />
😭 some folk who have been doing great work are moving off the team<br />
🙌 zuhlke folk that have joined us are starting to build a head of steam <br />
~ fun at points <br /></p>

<p>❌ it was a good week but…<br />
🤦 so disappointed with the lazy response from Co-op on advertising in GB News<br />
💸 if your principles are only firm when they don't cost you money, they're not principles<br />
🤔 a female colleague quote tweeted me about it. They had trolls respond and, I didn't. A little view of the misogynists that Co-op is choosing to pander to<br />
⌨️ only wrote code for fun this week<br />
😰 SO MANY BUSYWORK MEETINGS<br />
💖 ended the week with a great meeting of minds about how to improve enterprise testing<br />
😍 and a wonderful session run by Andy Tabberer that has changed how I see the world and behave<br />
💣 attended a CAB for the first time in three years, I'm certain this process adds nothing <br />
❓ what fun I had was all offset by organisational pathology <br /></p>

<p>⌨️ spent quite a bit of time (helping) writing code this week<br />
🔁 some code to automate browser performance testing<br />
😰 lots of time swearing at YAML and waiting for lambda@edge's slow feedback cycle<br />
💖 bits of time meeting different people to try and understand them better<br />
😱 some time staring into the middle distance in frustration<br />
🤗 some opportunities to give feedback<br />
✅ had fun (intermittently)</p>

<p>🛹 onboarded 10 new team members from Zuhlke this week <br />
🤷 it went surprisingly smoothly <br />
💖 so much effort and kindness from everyone to make it work<br />
🎹 no time writing code this week so, I ended the week test driving a state machine <br />
🗺 took part in more Wardley mapping <br />
🙌 attended a diversity and inclusion session <br />
🎓 the work that some of the senior leaders have put in to learn about D&amp;I shines through in how they talk <br />
😍 promised Chris L that I'd include they said nice things, cos they did, and it always helps to get feedback
✅ had fun (despite the odds)</p>

<p>😭 yet another rollercoaster week <br />
😥 too much work for everyone <br />
🍀 time with the engineers was only through luck<br />
📽 writing lots of decks this week <br />
🐦 a quick play with AWS canary - really very cool <br />
🙌 some awesome sessions run this week <br />
🗺 took part in some Wardley mapping <br />

<p>😭 another rollercoaster week <br />
💖 received nice feedback, that got me through the week <br />
❌ almost didn't get to spend any time with the engineers <br />
👀 the time I did get was because of a heisenbug in production <br />
🤩 new starter from a new partner - if the others are even half as good we're in a great place <br />
🌗 thought that I'd achieved something I'd been heading at for weeks <br />
👎 but no (not yet!) <br />
✅ had fun (barely, thanks to awesome team)</p>

<p>😭 about as low as I've been at work ever at points this week <br />
💖 value that I felt safe to be open about it and that people were there <br />
❌ almost didn't get to spend any time with the engineers <br />
👀 the time I did get was eye-opening and useful <br />
✍️ finally getting to the point I have enough of an internalised model of funeralcare to start to communicate <br />
🧠 I still know nothing, but I think I might have found some of the edges <br />
🤗 I've too much to do, asked for help, and it was so much better <br />
🗣 spent some time with a friend from the local dev community talking about work stuff <br />
🤩 did similar recently with someone else about event sourcing questions they had <br />
💖 feel very lucky to be part of a community <br />
😍 and thankful for all the folk that run user groups and community events<br />

<p>🎢 another wild ride <br />
❌ didn't expect to get to spend time with the engineers <br />
🔬 awesome colleague suggested a smart experiment <br />
🪵 another awesome collegue spotted a problem and did the right thing <br />
🍒 and I got to pair on some low hanging fruit <br />
💖 started the week receiving lovely feedback <br />
💉 had covid vaccine number one <br />

❌ didn't expect to get to spend time with the engineers <br />
👍 managed to drop in a few times <br />
👎 only short sessions though <br />
🏃‍♂️ still hard miles but some great, open, honest things this week <br />
💖 received feedback <br />
📈 I love not having to guess about where I can get better <br />
🚶‍♂️ met lovely people for a walk in the actual world <br />

     "articleBody":"We've  had  photovoltaic  (PV)  solar  panels  generating  electricity  on  our  roof  for  exactly  5  years.  I've  explained  the  impact  a  few  times  privately  or  on  the  tooter  website.  I'm  writing  it  down  here  so  that  I  don't  have  to  re-remember  all  the  details  each  time.  And  since  electricity  prices  are  in  the  news  at  the  moment  and  it  might  be  useful  to  some  folks.\n\nWe  had  14  panels  installed  on  25th  August  2017.  It  cost  £4,793.25  which  included  5%  VAT.  Our  house  is  south  facing  at  the  rear.  They've  generated  17.06MWh  of  electricity  in  the  last  five  years.\n\nThat's  17,060Kwh  or  a  little  over  17,000  \"units\".\n\nAnd  that  represents  around  4  tonnes  of  CO2  \"saved\".\n\n\n\nWhat  we  have\n\nWe  have  11  panels  on  the  south  facing  roof.\n\n\n\nAnd  3  on  the  east  facing  roof.\n\n\n\nYou  can  see  the  lifetime  generation  of  each  panel  in  those  images.  The  south-facing  panels  have  each  generated  around  1.3MWh  and  the  east-facing  panels  around  1MWh.\n\nThere  is  an  inverter  in  the  attic  and  a  generation  meter  alongside  our  gas  and  electricity  meters  in  the  hall.  The  inverter  from  SolarEdge  emits  some  metrics  over  wi-fi  and  we  have  an  app  that  lets  us  see  them.\n\n\n\nSolar  Energy  sales  people  behaved  horribly.  It  was  like  the  worst  experience  of  buying  a  car.  We  were  lucky  that  we  found  \"Just  Energy  Solutions\"  who  seemed  trustworthy  and  had  soft-touch  sales.  They  drove  up  from  Bristol  and  completed  the  installation  in  a  day.  I  would  happily  recommend  them  but  they  aren't  trading  any  more.\n\nGeneration\n\nWe  did  lose  some  data  when  I  changed  my  wifi  network  and  forgot  about  the  metrics  for  a  few  weeks.  So  we've  generated  an  unknown  amount  more  than  17.06MWh.  You  can  see  the  drop  in  Q3  2019  below.  Which  suggests  we've  actually  generated  closer  to  17.5MWh.\n\n\n\nWe  don't  have  a  battery.  So  we  do  still  draw  from  the  grid.  Because,  while  we  generate  almost  as  much  as  we  use,  we  don't  always  generate  electricity  when  we  are  using  it.  :)\n\nA  battery  was  at  least  £3000  at  time  of  installation.  And  this  was  already  an  expensive  luxury.  We  chose  a  slightly  more  expensive  inverter.  So  that  we  could  still  add  a  battery  in  future.\n\nFeed-in-tariff\n\nWe  receive  some  payments  from  the  UK  feed-in-tariff.  Roughly  5p  for  every  KWh  we  generate  and  another  5p  for  every  KWh  we  export.  For  small  installations  you  aren't  required  to  meter  generation  and  export.  So  the  tariff  assumes  that  we  export  50%  of  what  we  generate.\n\nSince  Nov  2018  (I  don't  have  all  the  records  available  online  and  I'm  too  lazy  to  find  the  paper  records)  we've  received  £950.21.  Naively  that's  an  interest  rate  of  around  4%.\n\nImmediate  use\n\nOur  generation  meter  shows  16,655KWh.  So  I  think  that  represents  405KWh  that  have  been  consumed  within  the  house  before  making  it  to  the  meter  (or  possibly  that  the  panels  metrics  don't  match  production  exactly  ¯\\(ツ)/¯  )\n\nAt  18.9  p/kWh  that's  another  £76.54  we've  not  had  to  spend  on  electricity\n\nElectricity  we've  not  had  to  pay  for\n\nThen  there's  the  electricity  we've  used  that  we  would  have  otherwise  paid  for.  Our  monitoring  isn't  detailed  enough  to  know  this  value.  Using  Ofgem  figures  British  Gas  suggests  our  household  would  use  4,300kWh  electricity  annually.\n\nOur  usage  is  around  3100kWh  annually.  Not  all  of  that  difference  will  be  due  to  the  panels  -  we're  super  careful  about  energy  use  -  but  that's  up-to  £200  a  year  more  that  we're  \"saving\".\n\nPrice  rises\n\n\n\nThe  UK  is  having  a  terrible  time  of  absent  government  and  unrestrained,  self-interested  capitalism  after  an  extended  period  of  government  by  money-vampire.  So,  electricity  is  expected  to  soon  be  52p/KWh.  That  potential  1200KWh  a  year  less  is  then  £600  a  year.\n\n## Payback  time\n\nPayback  time  is  the  time  it  takes  for  income  and  savings  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  installation.  Before  Solar  PV  installation  we  had  other  work  done  on  the  roof.  The  payback  time  of  that  investment  in  the  roof  was…  …  infinity.  No  part  of  our  house  generated  income  before  we  got  the  panels.\n\nWe  were  in  the  lucky  position  to  care  more  about  offsetting  our  environmental  impact  than  the  financial  return  on  investment.\n\nHowever,  based  on  the  last  five  years  and  assuming  (despite  what's  happening  right  now)  that  electricity  prices  rise  with  inflation  then  the  payback  time  is  15-20  years.\n\nOver  the  coming  years  prices  will  rise,  my  kids  will  move  out  (🙏),  and  our  electricity  demand  will  fall.  So  I'd  expect  payback  to  be  more  like  10-15  years.\n\nBut  I'm  not  relying  on  it!\n\nWould  I  recommend  you  get  panels?\n\nHaving  £4k  to  invest  is  a  privileged  position.  If  you  have  that  money,  a  south  or  east  facing  roof,  and  can  expect  not  to  move  house  for  at  least  5  to  10  years.  Then  I  think  this  is  a  fantastic  way  to  do  something  positive  with  your  money.\n\nHowever\n\nInsulate,  insulate,  insulate.  Then  do  more  insulation.  You  should  reduce  the  need  to  heat  your  home  as  much  as  practically  possible  before  doing  anything  else.  Both  for  income  and  eco-  reasons.\n\nAngry  moralising\n\nIt  is  very  hard  to  avoid  angry  moralising  while  writing  about  this.  There  is  such  a  failure  of  vision  about  how  we  could  build  and  use  energy  infrastructure.  Leaving  those  most  in  need  with  the  least  support.  All  the  while  the  shiny-faced  suits-full-of-piss  in  government  squeeze  the  system  of  every  penny  for  their  friends  and  family.\n\nI  really  hope  we  can  figure  out  how  to  be  better.\n"

		<p>We've had photovoltaic (PV) solar panels generating electricity on our roof for exactly 5 years. I've explained the impact a few times privately or <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apauldambra%20AND%20solar&amp;src=typed_query">on the tooter website</a>. I'm writing it down here so that I don't have to re-remember all the details each time. And since electricity prices are in the news at the moment and it might be useful to some folks.</p>

<p>We had 14 panels installed on 25th August 2017. It cost £4,793.25 which included 5% VAT. Our house is south facing at the rear. They've generated 17.06MWh of electricity in the last five years.</p>

<p>That's 17,060Kwh or a little over 17,000 "units".</p>

<p>And that represents around 4 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> "saved".</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="what-we-have">What we have</h2>

<p>We have 11 panels on the south facing roof.</p>

<p><img src="/images/solar/panels-south.png" alt="the layout and lifetime generation of the south facing panels" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>And 3 on the east facing roof.</p>

<p><img src="/images/solar/panels-east.png" alt="the layout and lifetime generation of the east facing panels" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>You can see the lifetime generation of each panel in those images. The south-facing panels have each generated around 1.3MWh and the east-facing panels around 1MWh.</p>

<p>There is an inverter in the attic and a generation meter alongside our gas and electricity meters in the hall. The inverter from <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/uk">SolarEdge</a> emits some metrics over wi-fi and we have an app that lets us see them.</p>

<p><img src="/images/solar/production.png" alt="production (by quarter) showing 2 or 3 MWh per year" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>We don't have a battery. So we do still draw from the grid. Because, while we generate almost as much as we use, we don't always generate electricity when we are using it. :)</p>

<p>A battery was at least £3000 at time of installation. And this was already an expensive luxury. We chose a slightly more expensive inverter. So that we could still add a battery in future.</p>

<h3 id="feed-in-tariff">Feed-in-tariff</h3>

<p>We receive some payments from <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/feed-in-tariffs/article/feed-in-tariffs/what-was-the-feed-in-tariff-aAsa36S95iJy">the UK feed-in-tariff</a>. Roughly 5p for every KWh we generate and another 5p for every KWh we export. For small installations you aren't required to meter generation <em>and</em> export. So the tariff assumes that we export 50% of what we generate.</p>

<p>Since Nov 2018 (I don't have all the records available online and I'm too lazy to find the paper records) we've received £950.21. Naively that's an interest rate of around 4%.</p>

<h3 id="immediate-use">Immediate use</h3>

<p>Our generation meter shows 16,655KWh. So I think that represents 405KWh that have been consumed within the house before making it to the meter (or possibly that the panels metrics don't match production exactly ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ )</p>

<p>At 18.9 p/kWh that's another £76.54 we've not had to spend on electricity</p>

<h3 id="electricity-weve-not-had-to-pay-for">Electricity we've not had to pay for</h3>

<p>Then there's the electricity we've used that we would have otherwise paid for. Our monitoring isn't detailed enough to know this value. Using Ofgem figures <a href="https://www.britishgas.co.uk/energy/guides/average-bill.html">British Gas suggests our household would use 4,300kWh electricity annually</a>.</p>

<p>Our usage is around 3100kWh annually. Not all of that difference will be due to the panels - we're super careful about energy use - but that's up-to £200 a year more that we're "saving".</p>

<h4 id="price-rises">Price rises</h4>

<!--alex ignore period-->

<p>The UK is having a terrible time of absent government and unrestrained, self-interested capitalism after an extended period of government by money-vampire. So, electricity is expected to soon be 52p/KWh. That potential 1200KWh a year less is then £600 a year.</p>

<p>## Payback time</p>

<p>Payback time is the time it takes for income and savings to pay for the cost of installation. Before Solar PV installation we had other work done on the roof. The payback time of that investment in the roof was… … infinity. No part of our house generated income before we got the panels.</p>

<p>We were in the lucky position to care more about offsetting our environmental impact than the financial return on investment.</p>

<p>However, based on the last five years and assuming (despite what's happening right now) that electricity prices rise with inflation then the payback time is 15-20 years.</p>

<p>Over the coming years prices will rise, my kids will move out (🙏), and our electricity demand will fall. So I'd expect payback to be more like 10-15 years.</p>

<p>But I'm not relying on it!</p>

<h2 id="would-i-recommend-you-get-panels">Would I recommend you get panels?</h2>

<p>Having £4k to invest is a privileged position. If you have that money, a south or east facing roof, and can expect not to move house for at least 5 to 10 years. Then I think this is a fantastic way to do something positive with your money.</p>

<h2 id="however">However</h2>

<p>Insulate, insulate, insulate. Then do more insulation. You should reduce the need to heat your home as much as practically possible before doing anything else. Both for income and eco- reasons.</p>

<h2 id="angry-moralising">Angry moralising</h2>

<p>It is very hard to avoid angry moralising while writing about this. There is such a failure of vision about how we could build and use energy infrastructure. Leaving those most in need with the least support. All the while the shiny-faced suits-full-of-piss in government squeeze the system of every penny for their friends and family.</p>

<p>I really hope we can figure out how to be better.</p>

<p>ğŸ‘ managed to hold only a single hour for coding <br />
ğŸ¤¯ everything still feels new so I asked lots of questions <br />
ğŸ™Œ I felt like I was slowing people down but the mob were welcoming <br />
ğŸ‘ again meeting time was focussed on ongoing work <br />
ğŸŒª but there's so much going on <br />
ğŸ¤” and I'm terrible at prioritising <br />
ğŸƒâ€â™‚ï¸ I'm biased towards action <br />
â˜¸ï¸ so all the planning isn't my wheelhouse <br />
âœ… had fun</p>

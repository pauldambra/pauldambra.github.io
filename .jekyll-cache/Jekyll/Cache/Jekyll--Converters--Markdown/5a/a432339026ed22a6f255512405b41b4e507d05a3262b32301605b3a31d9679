<p>ğŸ¢ this week has been wild <br />
 ğŸ’ what a simply wonderful time to work with people that care at a company that wants to do good<br />
 ğŸ¤³ seems ridulously self-interested to waffle about how hard or not I've found this week when folk are losing their income<br /></p>

<p>Schools are closing. We used to homeschool. I wondered if it would be useful to share what we learned.</p>

<p>I wrote hundreds of words on homeschooling. My wife laughed at me. Told me to stop waffling and said â€œwrite this downâ€</p>

<p>Obvs this was our experience, with our kids, in our context butâ€¦</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let them play. Play is learning.</li>
  <li>Youâ€™re not a teacher. Thatâ€™s ok. Teaching is hard (kudos teachers ğŸ‘‘).</li>
  <li>Youâ€™re not teaching 30 kids so donâ€™t act like you are. A couple of hours of "teaching" a day will likely be plenty (and plenty exhausting).</li>
  <li>Put stuff out theyâ€™ve not played with recently e.g. things to count with, puzzles, a book they hardly ever look at. Just leave it out for them to notice.</li>
  <li>Use their interests. Talk to them about the topic you want to teach while theyâ€™re playing. Baking, shopping, accounting, planning an imaginary business.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t get sucked in to the overwhelming amount of resources. twinkl is free right now. TES has resources for older kids. Thereâ€™s so much online you can get sucked in to just comparing them. We had the most success when we just spent some time with them doing something at whatever level theyâ€™re at.</li>
  <li>There are amazing homeschoolers that look like theyâ€™ve got it sorted. Social media will make it look like youâ€™re not doing a good job cos others share at their best. But their house is messy and full of fighting kids too. They just donâ€™t take photos while thatâ€™s happening</li>
  <li>What worked for us was making sure we went outside every day. Even if it was wet</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="i-made-these">I made these:</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pauldambra.dev/readerer/">https://pauldambra.dev/readerer/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pauldambra.dev/round-it/">https://pauldambra.dev/round-it/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pauldambra.dev/get-to-1000/">https://pauldambra.dev/get-to-1000/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Or rather they are the ones I kept. Iâ€™d see how quickly I could make something that helped them or held their attention. #3 loved being allowed to hold my phone and shouting at readerer The other two loved getting cat gifs as rewards</p>

<p>ğŸ¨Iâ€™d love to see what the digital community all make as learning resources. <br />
ğŸ‘©â€â¤ï¸â€ğŸ‘©It's such a strange time in the world. Remember to be kind to others and to yourself.<br /></p>

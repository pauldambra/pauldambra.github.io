<p>â˜¯ï¸ saw the best and worst sides of being at a big company this week<br />
ğŸ—º saw people hear the word "plan" and assume it means a loss of autonomy<br />
â“‡ agile still has requirements<br />
ğŸ’¡ it just doesn't pretend it can get them all right on day one<br />
| agile still has deadlines<br />
ğŸ”­ but it plays with scope to meet them<br />
ğŸš€ lots of same day fixes again this week<br />
âœ… had fun</p>

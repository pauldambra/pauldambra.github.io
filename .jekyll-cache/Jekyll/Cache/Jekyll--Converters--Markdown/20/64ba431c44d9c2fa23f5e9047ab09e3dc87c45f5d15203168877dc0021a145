<p>ğŸ’– 2 big incredible things this week<br />
ğŸ’ª we're trialling locking your account when you log in if you have a known compromised (pwned) password<br />
ğŸ” we turned on the AWS WAF in front of a subset of our systems<br />
ğŸš€ both things have been a labour of love<br />
ğŸ—£ lots of meetings but still feel like I've spent time with the team<br />
â“ wish I knew how so I could do that more<br />
âœ… had fun</p>

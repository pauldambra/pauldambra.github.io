<p>ğŸŒª felt like I was running around spinning plates this week <br />
ğŸ’– love that someone noticed and reminded me to talk and let people help <br />
ğŸ”­ worked remote two days. It was ok but strange to start something new on a background of anxiety <br />
ğŸ§­ feeling disconnected from the why of some things <br />
ğŸ˜ new colleague joined us and has got stuck in right away <br />
ğŸ‘©â€ğŸ‘©â€ğŸ‘§â€ğŸ‘¦ had our Friday show and tell remotely. Which worked well but was a bit weird <br />
ğŸ¦„ discovered that two things I've been worrying about have been started and practically finished <br />
âœ… had fun</p>

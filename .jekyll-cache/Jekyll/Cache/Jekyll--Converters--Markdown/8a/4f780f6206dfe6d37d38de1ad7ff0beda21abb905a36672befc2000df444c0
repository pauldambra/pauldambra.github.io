<p>ğŸ¢ this 5 day week has felt 2 days long - wat<br />
ğŸ—£ aimed to spend 10 hours with engineers doing the typey-typey <br />
ğŸ‘ managed 6 hours <br />
ğŸ˜ it is a balm for the soul <br />
ğŸƒâ€â™‚ï¸ some of what is happening is really hard and draining <br />
ğŸ‘©â€â¤ï¸â€ğŸ‘¨ but somehow this week still felt good for more time than not <br />
ğŸ’– seeing folk working to improve and be kind recharges me <br />
âœ… had fun</p>

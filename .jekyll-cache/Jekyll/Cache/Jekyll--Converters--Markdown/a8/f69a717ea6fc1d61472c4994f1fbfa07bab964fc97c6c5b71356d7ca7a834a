<p>😫 this week was full on!<br />
🎩 had to change hats so often - people management, presenting, refactoring, coaching, architecting, and more. <br />
🛏️ I'm frazzled<br />
🦸‍♀️ lots of folk dealing with frustrating circumstances this week<br />
💖 wonderful to see people pull together<br />
💻 spent most of a day with the mob working on offers<br />
🗣️ banged on about pipes and filters<br />
💎 automated weeknotes out of my blog with some ruby<br />
✅ had fun</p>

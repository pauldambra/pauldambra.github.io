<p>🎥 a week of being frustrated and learning how (not?) to do video calls <br />
💖 still incredible to see everyone supporting each other <br />
🔭 it's lovely to be surrounded by family all the time but… <br />
❓ what am I supposed to do - turns out my job was looking for serendipitous conversations… <br />
🧭 and helping nudge things in the right direction or help give people courage to try something <br />
🏚 that's not going to work now so I need to find a better way to contribute <br />
🚀 fascinating to see this normally slow company try to act at furious pace <br />
👩‍⚕️ important to figure out how to keep some of this new bold pace once we're past the pandemic <br />
✅ had fun</p>
